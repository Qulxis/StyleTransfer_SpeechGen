Nothing is more important now than doing everything in our power to stop the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
"Big banks borrow money from the Federal Reserve at 2.25%.. . Then they can charge you a 30% interest rate on your credit card.. . Today, loan sharks wear fancy suits and work on Wall Street.. . There must be a limit on their greed. My bill with @AOC caps all credit card rates at 15%."
"The Green New Deal is not only about saving our planet, it is about creating millions of jobs for the American people—family-sustaining, union jobs with benefits. Thank you, @SEIU. This is what leadership and solidarity are about."
The coronavirus reminds us that we are all in this together. We cannot allow Americans to skip doctor's visits over outrageous bills.. . Everyone should get the medical care they need without opening their wallet—as a matter of justice and public health.
"The Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus is a disgrace.. . Our nurses on the frontlines of this crisis must have the protective gear, the safety protocols, and testing they need to care for our people."
"It is not acceptable that 68,000 Americans die each year because they cannot afford the health care they desperately need. It’s time to end this international embarrassment. It’s time to guarantee health care in the United States to all. It’s time for Medicare for All."
"When you have an extremely profitable, well-financed corporation owned by one of the wealthiest guys in the world, you know what? You should not be demanding wage cuts from your workers and cuts in their health care benefits. That’s just wrong."

We must have the courage to take on the greed of billionaire CEOs and their lobbyists.
"“It’s demeaning. It’s demoralizing. It’s unjust.” That's what a rigged political system looks like. As a House member in 1999, I led a trip to Canada to buy cheaper drugs. Twenty years later, people are still organizing 'caravans' to buy insulin they need."
"Donald Trump may not like it, but we are not an authoritarian country. The OSC recommendation is very clear: Ms. Conway must be removed from the federal government for violating the law."

"On the anniversary of the horrific Sandy Hook shootings, we must recommit to doing everything we can to stop gun violence.. . The House passed gun-safety legislation almost 300 days ago. Senator McConnell's obstruction is unacceptable. Now is the time to save lives in this country."
This is a terrible time. But to throw our hands up in despair is not going to solve the problem. We must work together to get out of the crises we face.
It is unconscionable that this man was given a lifetime prison sentence and kept behind bars for 36 years—for stealing $50 at the age of 22.. . We have a racist criminal justice system that must be fundamentally transformed.
"Let’s be absolutely clear about what Trump is doing with his latest food stamps work requirements rule: he is attacking the poor.. . We should be expanding programs like food stamps that lift people out of poverty, not making them even harder to access."
Trump is working to:. • enable corporate tax evasion. • let factories dump toxic chemicals into wetlands. • limit food inspections . • collect debt from defrauded students. • increase car pollution. . This is the most corrupt presidency in modern history.
Our fight to end the fossil fuel industry’s destruction of our planet is not going away anytime soon.. . Even the geniuses on Wall Street are starting to figure that out.
Even the Congressional Budget Office run by the Republicans concluded that Medicare for All would provide universal health care to everyone in America and cost $650 billion LESS than our current dysfunctional health care system each and every year. Yes. We need #MedicareForAll.

POSTPONED: Tonight’s livestreamed Q&A discussion with the White House’s COVID-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha is postponed. We will be announcing a new date and time soon!
Visiting Vermont summer programs in Burlington and Fairfield. Yes. This is more fun than Senate committee meetings.

"Corporate greed is Jeff Bezos becoming $152,000 richer a MINUTE, owning a $500 million yacht & a $175 million Beverly Hills estate, while Amazon employees who worked over 10 hours on Easter Sunday might be ""lucky enough” to win a $2 snack pack. Yes. Amazon workers need a union."
Trump is a scam artist and a demagogue. He is using racism to divide working people and distract from his loyalty to billionaires and huge corporations. It won't work. The American people will come together and defeat this strategy of fomenting hate.
"Trump's war on the poor continues. First he wants to throw millions off nutrition assistance and Medicaid, and now he's going after affordable housing. Trump's agenda is simple: tax breaks for the rich, devastating cuts for the poor. We must fight back and create a moral economy."
"""President Trump's decision to violate the [Iran nuclear] agreement was by far the most destructive act of his presidency."" -@Cirincione #BernieTownHall"
"I expect that colleagues today will be arguing that we are not really engaged in the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Well, tell that to the people of Yemen, whose homes and lives are being destroyed by weapons marked “Made in the USA,"" dropped by planes refueled by the U.S. military."
"In America today, the average student-loan debt for a four-year degree is over $28,000..  . When asked how big their student debt was, people from Denmark, Taiwan, Ireland, Brazil, the Philippines, Scotland, Turkey, and Canada all gave the same answer: $0."

The Senate will soon begin considering a transformational piece of legislation. I'm on the floor NOW giving remarks about what's in it.
"In support of our wonderful “ally,” Saudi Arabia, Trump has provoked war with Iran and kept us in an unconstitutional war in Yemen. Instead of giving the Saudis more bombs, he should take a hard look at the brutal, antidemocratic regime he loves so much."
Why does Mick Mulvaney think it's OK to cut heating assistance for low-income Americans while giving massive tax breaks to the Koch brothers?

The situation in Gaza is a humanitarian crisis. The United States must play a more aggressive and even-handed role in ending the Gaza blockade and helping Palestinians and Israelis build a future that works for all.
"Yes, it's important that McDonald's pigs be treated humanely. But maybe it's more important that we take care of the humans who work there by paying them a living wage and making it easier to form a union, instead of spending $15 billion on stock buybacks to enrich the wealthy."
"If you paid $12.99 a month for an Amazon Prime membership, you paid more to Amazon than it paid in federal income taxes over the past 3 years combined—after making nearly $30 billion in profits. Yes. It's time to make corporations pay their fair share of taxes."
"I'm deeply disappointed that Congress again abdicated its constitutional duty to authorize war. Over and over, Congress has sat back and failed to ask the hard questions as administrations have misled us into conflicts, including Vietnam and Iraq, with disastrous consequences."

In the last 20 years alone the pharmaceutical industry has spent $3.6 billion in lobbying. They have an endless amount of money and they use it to maintain a system which allows them to raise prices as they choose. #MedicareForAll
Republicans' tax bill would throw 13 million Americans off of health insurance. Here's how:

McDonald's just announced it is spending $6 billion on makeovers of its restaurants while still refusing to pay its workers a living wage.

Thank you @WCHospital for your hospitality. I learned a great deal today about how we can improve the American health care system.
You don’t fix a rigged economy by giving huge tax breaks to the billionaires and corporations that rigged it.
"Here's a fact you don't hear too often: Half of America’s workers make less than $19 an hour..  . When we double the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15, we'll boost pay up the income ladder. That means workers making above $15 an hour—11.6 million of them—will also get raises."
"No, this isn't it, Ms. DeVos. Cancel all student debt."
The Gap corporation didn’t give a damn about struggling workers as it showered its failing CEO with millions of dollars a year. . . We will no longer tolerate socialism for the rich and powerful. Congress must pass our Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act.

"What issue do you think got more coverage on CNN today, the effort to deregulate the major banks or Donald Trump and a porn star? Think hard!"
This is a story that should be on CNN. This is the real impact of the Trump administration on families in America.
"McDonald's made $5.1 billion in profits last year and rewarded wealthy shareholders with over $7.7 billion.. . Meanwhile, many McDonald's workers need food stamps, Medicaid and public housing to survive.. . That is unacceptable. McDonald's workers need $15 and a union."
I'm proud to stand in solidarity with the employees at Ford GoBike in San Francisco who are voting to join the Transport Workers Union on March 28th. We cannot have a strong and vibrant middle class without a strong and vibrant trade union movement.
Those of us who believe in democracy must understand the scope of the challenge of authoritarianism if we are to effectively confront it.
"If Amazon is so proud of the way it treats its workers, why won’t it make public the number of people it hires through temporary staffing agencies like Integrity Staffing Solutions and the hourly rate and benefits those workers earn?"
President Biden is exactly right. I stand in strong solidarity with the workers who are taking on Kellogg’s greed.

There can be no free society without a free media. The work of journalists in this country is absolutely essential to our communities and to a free and functioning democracy. Journalists should never have to fear for their lives as they do their work. #WorldPressFreedomDay
"Americans should not pay an outrageous price for a drug that their tax dollars helped develop. Today’s action by CMS, along with Secretary Becerra’s move to direct Medicare to reconsider a premium rate hike caused in part by the price of Aduhelm, is an important step forward."
"There has not been one public hearing, no opportunity to hear from economists, governors, mayors or ordinary Americans who will be impacted by this tax bill. This is a sham."
The cost of going to a dentist has gone up by more than 80 percent since 1990.
How absurd is it that we have completely ignored the need to create an efficient unemployment system?. . The establishment's contempt for working-class people is a sickness.
"The Iraq war led to the deaths of 4,500 U.S. troops, and the wounding of tens of thousands. It led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, and the displacement of over 5 million people.. . And after all that, the Iraqi parliament voted last week to boot U.S. forces out."
No one should die because they can't afford medication they need. But that's what happens when we let drug makers charge whatever they want.
We asked Republicans to pass a budget that would protect the needs of working families. They preferred to shut down the government instead.
"One might have thought given all the Republicans in the House and Senate, a vast number would be standing up and saying the president's racist comments do not reflect the views of their party. It is sad and disappointing the degree to which Trump's ideology has dominated the GOP."
"Six trillion dollars have been spent on the so-called war on terror. That is an unbelievable amount of money. Do we really need to spend more than the next ten nations combined on the military, when our infrastructure is collapsing and young people can't afford to go to college?"
"AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson promised to create ""7,000 good jobs for the middle class"" after Trump's tax cut was passed, yet the company has been laying off thousands of workers and shipping those jobs overseas to countries where workers can be paid less than $2 an hour."
"I have invited Jeff Bezos to testify in the Budget Committee next week to explain to the American people why he thinks it's appropriate for him to spend a whole lot of money denying economic dignity to workers at Amazon, while he has become $78 billion richer during the pandemic."
The Trump administration should start paying attention to the serious problems facing our country and let the people of the United Kingdom decide their own political future.
"In the richest country in the history of the world, Americans should not have to live in fear that they will die because they cannot afford the life-saving medication they need. Pharma's greed is killing Americans and that has got to end. (with @BizHealthPol)"
Yes. Congress should work to expand U.S. microchip production. No. As part of the Endless Frontiers bill we should not be handing out $53 billion in corporate welfare to some of the largest and most profitable corporations in the country with no strings attached.
"Mike Pompeo is absolutely the wrong choice for secretary of state. He is a supporter of the Global Gag Rule. He opposes LGBTQ rights. And as the top recipient of money from the Koch brothers, he's stymied action on one of our most serious security threats: global climate change."
"Yesterday, the United States Senate unanimously passed our resolution supporting free and fair elections in Brazil. We are sending a clear, bipartisan message that we are on the side of the people of Brazil and on the side of democracy."
STARTING NOW: The Inequality in America National Town Hall #InequalityTownHall
"Estimates show that nearly 27 million Americans and their families lost their health care coverage when they lost their jobs due to COVID-19. Let me be clear: health care is a human right, not a job benefit. Yes. It’s time for Medicare for All."
"After surviving an attempt on his life, Russian activist Alexei Navalny has been detained after bravely returning to Russia today. I call for his release.. . The United States must stand with those fighting corruption and working for democracy around the world."
Port truck drivers are cheated out of an estimated $850 million a year. They're driving for 20 hours a day and taking home paychecks worth nothing. They are denied health care and overtime pay. This is modern-day slavery.
Strong unions are key to solving the crises facing higher education. I am delighted to join @repmarkpocan in this effort to protect graduate student workers who are organizing for their rights.
"The fact that we have a President of the United States who doesn't believe in science is an international embarrassment and incredibly dangerous.. . Climate change is already causing devastating consequences. We need bold action, not denials."
"Today, Trump granted clemency to tax cheats, Wall Street crooks, billionaires, and corrupt government officials.. . Meanwhile thousands of poor and working-class kids sit in jail for nonviolent drug convictions.. . This is what a broken and racist criminal justice system looks like."
"No, Donald Trump, there are no votes for you to find. The American people have spoken and at 12:01 pm on January 20, you will no longer be president."
"Two years ago, Hurricane María—fueled by climate change—devastated Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands..  . Our message for the people of those islands: you are not forgotten. We will fight for you, as American citizens, to fully rebuild for a sustainable and resilient future."

"""American policy in the Middle East is in free fall."" –@Cirincione #BernieTownHall"
"The establishment says there's no alternative to an unfettered capitalism that produces huge CEO bonuses while millions are paid starvation wages. They are dead wrong. Instead of more tax breaks to profitable corporations, let’s expand employee ownership."
"The inaction and denialism of Trump and Bolsonaro are threatening not just our lives, but also future generations. . . Americans and Brazilians must come together to defeat these rightwing demagogues and act immediately to save the planet—our only home—from climate catastrophe."
"Some argue that the US is not really engaged in hostilities in Yemen. But as these Yemeni human rights activists told me recently, when Yemenis see ""Made in USA"" on the bombs killing their children, it’s very clear that the US is part of this war. This must end."
"I am not interested in a photo op at an Amazon warehouse. I am calling for Labor Department inspectors to come in, unannounced, and do thorough investigations of the facilities where hundreds of workers have told me about horrendous conditions and abuse."
Far too many young people are unable to obtain the good-paying jobs that are out there because they lack the higher education. It’s long due time that every American have the right to two years of free community college.
"In the richest country on earth, our health care workers are facing shortages of the basic tools they need to fight this pandemic.. . We must immediately ramp up American manufacturing to make the testing kits, ventilators, protective gear, and other lifesaving equipment we need."
"Here’s an idea: How about an agenda that isn’t about corporate trade deals that sell out our workers, tax cuts for billionaires, and endless war? . . For once let’s focus on dignity for the working class. Let’s create millions of good jobs to take care of each other and our planet."
We must never succumb to despair or lose hope for a brighter future. We must continue the fight for a more just and decent world.
Brett Kavanaugh lied repeatedly to the Senate Judiciary Committee. He does not belong on the Supreme Court.
You can now get at-home COVID-19 tests delivered to your home for free. . . Go to to order your free tests now. It takes less than 30 seconds.
You cannot run a government on a month-to-month basis. We cannot continue to abdicate our responsibility. We must address the problems facing the American people.
"Bob Dole served his country with courage on the battlefield, and with dignity in the Senate. Jane and I send our condolences to his family."
Working families could face a 40% increase in their premiums as they’re dealing with this pandemic.. . America's for-profit insurance industry is not compatible with health care as a human right. . . Now is not the time for greed. Now is the time for Medicare for All.
"With a sense of urgency, Democrats must have the courage to take on powerful special interests and fight for a progressive agenda that addresses the needs of working families."
"Did you know we once had a Republican president who expanded Social Security? Maybe today's Republicans should listen to what he had to say about the program, instead of trying to destroy it."
"Ultimately, we face a choice: do we tolerate the insatiable greed of the billionaire class, whose control over our political system lets them take food out of the mouths of hungry school kids? . . Or do we build an equitable society that ends poverty, hunger and homelessness?"

We cannot delay any longer: we must protect our oceans and the diversity of life that they provide for.. . We will create millions of jobs building a sustainable economy to end the carbon emissions and run-off pollution that are devastating our seas.
States are competing to buy medical masks that went from $0.58 to $7 a piece.. . We cannot tolerate price-gouging in the middle of this pandemic.. . The president must immediately use the Defense Production Act to order companies to make the protective gear our health workers need.
"Nobody should be ""drowning,"" worrying about becoming homeless, because of crushing student debt in the United States of America.. . It is time to tax Wall Street to fund student debt cancellation and tuition-free public colleges for all."
It's never been more clear who the Trump Administration is really working for.
The greatest weapon our opponents have is not just their unlimited wealth and power. It is their ability to create a culture that makes us feel weak and hopeless and diminishes the strength of human solidarity..  . We cannot let them succeed.
"Instead of protecting our environment and combating climate change, Pruitt has worked to protect the interests of the fossil fuel industry and polluters all over the country. His resignation is a positive step forward for our country."
"The overriding motivation of the pharmaceutical industry is greed. Their overriding goal is to make as much money as they can by squeezing as much as they possibly can out of the sick, out of the elderly and out of the desperate."
It is not just a coincidence that 46% of all new income is going to the top 1%. That is the result of an economy that is rigged in favor of the wealthy.
"I congratulate my friend @SenatorLeahy for casting his 16,000th vote in the U.S. Senate! Senator Leahy has worked tirelessly for the people of Vermont since 1974, bringing our state's values of justice and openness to Washington. I look forward to continuing our work together."
".@HasanMinhaj is right. Instead of just worrying about Wall Street, maybe it's time we start worrying about the 45 million Americans with $1.6 trillion in student debt. We could start by canceling it."
When we talk about oligarchy in America we are talking about 700 billionaires who became nearly $2 trillion richer during the pandemic & pay a lower tax rate than a nurse while the child poverty rate soared by 41% in January because the expanded Child Tax Credit ended.
History must record that this Congress made it clear that no president can incite his followers into insurrection. This was an outrageous attack on the democratic foundations of which this country is built.. . Trump must be impeached and convicted.
"Republicans in Washington are happy to cheer on Trump's bogus conspiracy theories on non-existent election fraud, but refuse to support him when it comes to providing a $2,000 direct payment to working class Americans facing economic desperation. Pathetic."
"If we are serious about calling ourselves a democracy, we must act NOW. We must end the filibuster in the Senate. We must end the voter suppression and extreme gerrymandering sweeping the country. Our democracy depends on it."
Mr. Trump said he'd fight for a trade policy to help American workers. He said he'd lower the trade deficit. He lied: It's gone up..  . His real agenda: Protect the profits of the pharmaceutical industry and make it easier for corporations to outsource jobs.
I will do everything possible to see that the next EPA administrator actually believes in environmental protection.
"The time is now. Do we do what the American people want? Do we fulfill what democracy is supposed to be about? Or does Congress, yet again, bow down to powerful special interests?.  . That's what this struggle is about."
"The minimum wage is worth less than it was 50 years ago.. . If wages had gone up with productivity, today it would be three times higher.. . Corporate America has been waging a war on workers for decades. It's about time working people stand up and fight back."
"Today, the top 1% own more wealth than the bottom 92%. That is absurd..  . We must take on the billionaires and fight for the needs of the working class."
"If a company disregards the health and safety of its workers, demands sick employees return to work, requires employees to work without masks, proper protection, social distancing or adequate ventilation they must be held accountable. We cannot give corporations a right to kill."
"Catalyst Pharmaceuticals raised the price of a life-saving drug from $0 to $375,000.. . Now patients are worried they are going to suffer or even die because of the greed of a drug company.. . If Catalyst does not substantially lower the price of this medication, Congress must act."
"Poverty is a death sentence. About 130,000 Americans die each and every year from poverty. #InequalityTownHall"
"In this budget, Republicans want to cut Medicare by $473 billion and Medicaid by over $1 trillion in the next 10 years. Disgraceful."
The U.S. is the most powerful economy on earth and we must lead the world in the fight against climate change. We can do that by passing the Green New Deal to save the planet and create millions of new jobs.
This Fox News judge does a great job explaining why President Trump is in real trouble.
LIVE NOW: I'm hosting a virtual town meeting with Vermont students to discuss the challenges they are facing during this terrible pandemic.
No sane person could support the absurd process that this bill has gone through. #HealthCareDebate
"Let's be clear. Trump and his crony DeJoy are working overtime to sabotage the Postal Service.. . Now is the time for all of us to stand with postal workers fighting to save USPS. Together, we will stop Trump from destroying the Postal Service."
"I am hopeful that, as we have seen with other racist and xenophobic Trump policies, the courts will step in to rein in these unlawful actions."
"Trump also blamed Iran for the disastrous war in Yemen, despite the fact that the Saudi-led coalition has caused the most destruction by far."
Trump and McConnell believe—at a time of obscene inequality—that they need to help out the richest 0.2% of Americans by repealing the estate tax.. . I have a better idea: raise the estate tax so that billionaires pay their fair share.
We need to stop imprisoning people for smoking marijuana and start prosecuting the crooks on Wall Street whose greed and illegal behavior caused the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression.
"By backing the Saudi coalition’s war in Yemen with weapons, aerial refueling, and targeting assistance, the United States is complicit in this atrocity. No one can seriously claim that our support for this war is actually making us safer."
"56 years after Bloody Sunday, we remember those who put everything on the line for democracy, equality and freedom. We must honor their legacy by passing legislation to protect and expand voting rights for generations to come."
We cannot allow people to be thrown onto the streets. We must extend the eviction moratorium.
Big surprise. It turns out a lot of Trump's talk about his tax cuts is a lie. Here are some of his most egregious claims:
"The President's statement to discredit Christine Blasey Ford is sexist, outrageous and based on ignorance. Dr. Blasey is a credible person who has made a very serious allegation. She must be treated with respect and not face intimidation."
"Do not forget: A Green New Deal not only helps us lead the world in combating climate change, but will create millions of good jobs in energy efficiency, sustainable energies like wind and solar, transportation and agriculture.. . For the sake of future generations, let's do it."
Cutting taxes on huge corporations doesn’t create jobs. It makes CEOs richer and puts a bigger burden on the middle class.
Palestinians in Gaza already faced hardship under a blockade. Now they're dealing with the coronavirus.. . My Senate colleagues and I call on Trump to send U.S. medical relief. And the Israeli government must also lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid.
"President Biden’s Student Loan Debt Relief application is now open, and it takes less than five minutes to apply. This is a MAJOR first step. Next step: Make education a fundamental right for all, not a privilege for the wealthy few.. . Apply today:"

"When history looks back on this period, I do not want people to see a U.S. Congress which worked overtime to protect billionaires and large corporations but turned its back on providing health care to vulnerable children."
"Mark Zuckerberg testifying before the Senate is a good first step, but nowhere near enough. Today’s hearing must be the beginning, not the end, of the discussion about the dramatic impact Facebook, technology companies and the internet at large play in our society."
"I’m glad to hear that the SALT provisions are no longer in play for Build Back Better. Democrats need to focus on the struggling working class, not giving more tax breaks to the wealthy."
"Today’s House Oversight hearing with Michael Cohen confirms what we already knew: the president is a liar, a racist, and very likely a criminal."
"CEO-to-worker pay gaps:. . Gap, Inc.: 3,566 to 1. McDonald's: 2,124 to 1. Disney: 1,424 to 1. Walmart: 1,076 to 1. . When the middle class is rebuilt, we will look back on this period in history and say, ""This was wrong. Why on Earth did we allow this kind of grotesque inequality?"""
The fight against the tax bill is not over. We need to stand together to protect working families.
"Trump's position on climate change is pathetic and an embarrassment to the world. We must fight back. On Jan. 31, join me and tens of thousands of people across the U.S. as we tune in to chart the path to go #FossilFree."
"Throughout our history, demagogues have always tried to demonize different people to divide us up.. . We will not let Trump succeed. We will break down the irrational hatred he is fomenting. We are going to build a politics of love, compassion, and unity."
TONIGHT AT 6:30 pm: Tune in to hear Vermont students talk about how we can address the needs of young people across our state and country. The event will be livestreamed right here. Students can register to participate at the link below.
This is an historic day. For the first time in 45 years the U.S. Senate came together to end an unauthorized war. We have woken up the Congress to its constitutional responsibility. This is the beginning of a new day.
"$4.7 billion a day.. . $32 billion a week.. . $141 billion a month.. . $845 billion over 6 months.. . That's how much 643 billionaires in America made during the pandemic, while 30 million Americans don't have enough food to eat. Yes. It's time for austerity for the billionaire class."
The crisis we face as a country is not voter fraud. It is voter suppression.
"Climate change is one of the greatest threats to global security. As we see more drought, as poor people are not able to grow the food they need, there will be migrations of millions of people all over the world. That is why we need a Green New Deal."
This is a man-made crisis. The solution is straightforward: Congress must keep workers on payroll and guarantee their paychecks until the pandemic is over.
"Prescription drug prices:. . Harvoni for Hepatitis C:. 🇺🇸$46,570. 🇨🇦$19,084. . Xarelto for blood clots:. 🇺🇸$558. 🇨🇦$85. . Descovy to prevent HIV infection:. 🇺🇸$1,872. 🇦🇺$496. . Yes, we must take on the pharmaceutical industry, lower drug prices, and use the savings to expand Medicare."
These ideas are not radical:. . 🏥Universal health care. 🛌Paid sick leave for all. 👷🏽‍♀️$15 minimum wage and a union. 🌏A livable planet for our kids. 👩🏽‍🎓Free preschool-to-graduate school education. . We have got to open up people's imagination as to the kind of world they can be living in.
"It’s time to abolish “qualified immunity"" so police officers can be held fully accountable for abuses they commit. No one is above the law."
"At this moment when our democratic institutions are in peril, ending #NetNeutrality protections would be devastating. The FCC must vote against ending a free and open internet."
"In my view, during this crisis, nobody in America should have to worry about a medical bill. They’ve got enough to worry about.. . Right now, our goal must be to protect every single one of our people and ensure that their basic right to health care is taken care of."
Today on #TaxDay Americans around the country are standing up against a Republican tax plan that looks out for the ultra-wealthy while leaving working families behind.
Will Trump talk about climate change in his State of the Union address tonight?
"If Finland and other Nordic countries can make child care affordable and accessible to all, the United States should be able to as well."
Walmart plans to buy back $20 billion of its own stock to enrich its executives and shareholders over a two-year period—not to pay its workers a living wage #CEOsvsWorkers
"The pandemic surges, people die, and Trump continues to ignore reality. Let us save lives by using the Defense Production Act to produce high quality masks for everyone, and distribute them free to every household. That's the legislation I am introducing."
No married couple in America should have to choose between divorce or bankruptcy to afford health care. We must pass Medicare for All.
Mr. Trump forgot to tell these truckers in Pennsylvania that only the top 0.2% of Americans would benefit by repealing the estate tax.
"I've never met a voter, Republican or Democrat, who is begging the government to let corporations pollute the sources we rely on for drinking water even more..  . Yet that's just what Trump is doing, threatening 117 million Americans. Big polluters are in charge of our government."
"Tonight I will deliver a live response to President Trump's Oval Office address, immediately following Sen. Schumer and Rep. Pelosi's response. Tune in here:"
"The major corporations want Congress to lift the debt ceiling. Yet, they continue to make massive campaign contributions to the Republican Party which refuses to pay the debt incurred under Trump, and is prepared to plunge the economy into a depression. Bullshit!"
"Yes. We have to think big not small. Healthcare, lifelong education, affordable housing and a clean environment are human rights. In this pivotal moment in human history, we must lead the world in a new direction."
"Mick Mulvaney tells us everything we need to know about how Washington works, and why wealthy special interests make billions in campaign contributions. Government should be about representing ordinary Americans, not just the rich and the powerful."
I have a feeling ABC will not be asking on its nightly news program tonight how Disney can make $9 billion in profits while three-quarters of Disneyland employees can’t afford basic living expenses.
"Remember: our ""crazy idea"" of universal health care is a reality in:. . Australia. Austria. Belgium. Canada. Chile. Czech Rep.. Denmark. Finland. France. Germany. Greece. Hungary. Iceland. Israel. Italy. Japan. Netherlands. New Zealand. Norway. Poland. Portugal. S. Korea. Spain. Sweden. Switz.. Turkey. U.K."
"Instead of fixing our broken health care system, Trump continues to waste time and endanger lives trying to kick people off Medicaid. . . He should listen to the 90 percent of Americans who think Medicaid is important and expand the program, not cut it."
"Not only does Trump want to permanently defund Social Security, he wants to give another huge capital gains tax break to the 1%. Well, I've got bad news for the president. We are not going to let him defund Social Security. We are going to expand Social Security and tax the rich."
"Rebuilding our crumbling physical infrastructure – roads, bridges, water systems – is important. Rebuilding our crumbling human infrastructure – health care, education, climate change – is more important. No infrastructure bill without the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill."
"Since 1995, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and United Technologies have paid nearly $3 billion in fines or related settlements for fraud or misconduct. Yet, those three companies alone received about $800 billion in defense contracts over the past 18 years."
The American people are united on issue after issue. We must legalize marijuana now—and expunge all past marijuana convictions as a matter of racial and economic justice.
"Fancy cars. Expensive art. Huge houses. The Waltons – the wealthiest family in the country – spend millions on themselves, but refuse to pay their workers a living wage."
"One vial of insulin cost $21 in 1996, compared to $320 in 2018. American lives are being lost because of pharma's greed. That has got to end."
"If Saudi Arabia, one of the worst violators of human rights in the world, wants to partner with Russia to jack up US gas prices, it can get Putin to defend its monarchy. We must pull all US troops out of Saudi Arabia, stop selling them weapons & end its price-fixing oil cartel."
"Let's be clear. Climate change is causing devastating harm in the U.S. and around the world. Not to pass the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill, which has unprecedented spending to cut carbon emissions, would be grossly irresponsible. We must pass this bill and save the planet."
"The majority of low-wage workers in America today are women and people of color.. . When we fight to double the minimum wage to a $15 living wage, we are fighting to advance racial, gender, and economic justice."
"Wealth of the richest Americans: $35.4 trillion. Wealth of the entire American middle class: $36.9 trillion. . Maybe, just maybe, it is time for Wall Street and the top 1 percent to start paying their fair share of taxes."
Today is a good day for Putin and the oligarchs in Russia. It is a bad day for people in the United States and all over the world who believe in democracy and who are trying to understand what world our idiot president lives in.
"Our infrastructure is crumbling. Instead of building a wall on the Mexican border, we should create millions of good-paying jobs rebuilding our roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, schools, airports and affordable housing."
"$4.9 billion: The cost of preventing 30 million people worldwide from starving to death. . $845 billion: 6-month wealth gain of 643 billionaires. . $8 trillion: Total wealth of 2,200 global billionaires. . No. The billionaire class cannot have it all while millions suffer. #TaxTheRich"
"Women on average make just 82 cents for every dollar a man is paid, and that pay gap is even larger for women of color and tipped workers. Equal pay for equal work is not a radical idea. It's an issue of basic justice."
This is very good news. We can't properly reform our broken criminal justice system without ending the death penalty. We must abolish the death penalty once and for all.
"Today on Rosa Parks' 106th birthday we must do more than just remember her lifetime of organizing. We must honor her by working to fulfill her vision of racial, economic and social justice."
Watch this Canadian doctor discuss the difference between practicing medicine in Canada versus the United States.
"The most severe heat in Pacific Northwest history is underway. Predicted to be “historic, dangerous, prolonged and unprecedented,” by the National Weather Service, it’s already rewriting the record books. Yes. We have to act BOLDLY to address climate change."
"Today, six Republicans had the courage to stand up to Trump and vote with Democrats to end the shutdown without spending billions on an unneeded wall. . . The ball is now in Mitch McConnell's court. He must stand up to Trump and put federal employees back to work."
"If today we had the same level of inequality we had forty years ago, the bottom 90% of American households would be earning $12,000 more every year.. . $120,000 per decade.. . Do not tell me we cannot afford to cover the paychecks of every worker during this horrific pandemic."
"The country’s biggest railroad companies made over $20 billion in profits last year, while rail workers haven’t seen a wage increase since 2019 and are currently without a contract. These workers deserve a fair contract and they deserve it NOW."
"Archbishop Tutu helped end apartheid in South Africa by reminding us, “if you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.” We remember this hero as we continue the work for equality and justice."
"Thank you to the young people leading the fight to put people over profits and transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to renewable energy. When we stand together, we can overcome the power of the fossil fuel industry. #ThisIsZeroHour #YouthClimateMarch"
Amazon is using its enormous power to dissuade the city of Seattle from passing a modest tax on profitable corporations to address their severe housing crisis. This is what corporate power and oligarchy is all about.
"""We believe in Norway that our health system is for the people of Norway and should not function as a cash cow for drug companies."" –Dr. Meetali Kakad"
"In 1923, researchers who discovered insulin sold the patent for $1 so it would be available to all. But drug companies hijacked this lifesaving medicine and now charge over $300 a vial..  . Let’s be clear about this: Big Pharma’s greed is literally killing people in this country."
Congratulations to Starbucks Workers United for winning the 100th union election at Starbucks coffee shops all over America. I say to Howard Schultz: Stop the union busting. Obey the law. Negotiate a fair contract with your workers now – no more delays. Enough is enough.
Billionaires in the United States should not be paying less in taxes than teachers and nurses.
"Let me be clear: There will not be a bipartisan infrastructure deal without a reconciliation bill that substantially improves the lives of working families and combats the existential threat of climate change. No reconciliation bill, no deal. We need transformative change NOW."
Jane and I want to take this opportunity to wish everyone a very Merry Christmas and a happy holiday season.
How many people need to die before Congress takes on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry?
"Amazon workers are urinating in bottles because they're afraid of failing to meet productivity targets, according to @J_Bloodworth who went undercover at an Amazon warehouse in the UK."
"The United States should support the rule of law, fair elections and self-determination for the Venezuelan people. We must condemn the use of violence against unarmed protesters and the suppression of dissent. 2/3"
"He promised to provide health care to ""everybody,"" but he supported legislation that would have thrown up to 32 million Americans off the health care they currently have."
"Only 12% of Americans believe the wealthy should receive a tax cut. So of course, Republicans are trying to give the wealthy a huge tax cut."
"We must make it clear to working people that we are prepared to take on the greed of the ruling class, that we have the courage to stand up and fight for their interests."
"Did you know we once had a Republican president who expanded Social Security? Maybe today's Republicans should listen to what he had to say about the program, instead of trying to destroy it."
"Unfettered capitalism is the Charles Koch family becoming $37 billion richer during a horrific pandemic while using their fortune not to alleviate homelessness or end child hunger in America, but to evict working families facing economic desperation from their homes."
We have trillions in funding for endless wars. We can damn well find the money to make sure our people are able to feed their families and pay their bills.
"American Airlines made $1.9 billion in profits last year, but many of its workers are forced to rely on food stamps to survive. . . Its time for American Airlines to offer its Envoy Air workers a new contract that pays them a living wage."
"Poverty is not a crime and hundreds of thousands of Americans, convicted of nothing, shouldn't be in jail because they can't afford cash bail. Our destructive and unjust cash bail process is part of our broken criminal justice system and must be ended."
"85,000 children have starved to death during the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen.. . The U.S. should not be part of Saudi Arabia's destructive foreign policy. Congress must end our participation in that war now, and help provide immediate humanitarian aid there to save lives."
"The U.S. government put a family in mandatory isolation. Now they're left with a $3,900 surprise hospital bill.. . Profiting during an outbreak is not only cruel—it threatens public health. All needed tests, treatment, and vaccines must be made free for all."
"Those who want to maintain the status quo in which the rich get richer while ordinary Americans struggle to make ends meet oppose the reconciliation bill.. . Well, I disagree. Now is the time, finally, for Congress to stand up for working families."
Let's be clear: 70% of tipped workers are women. We will not have equal pay for equal work until we increase the $2.13 sub-minimum wage - which has not gone up in 30 years - to $15 an hour and adopt one fair wage. We must end the crisis of starvation wages in America.
"The wealth of the Walton family, the owners of Walmart, increased more than 9,000% since 1982.. . Walmart still doesn’t pay their workers a living wage.. . This is what a rigged economy is all about."
Ridiculous. The idea of “clean coal” is pure fiction. It's a concept intended to keep us tied to fossil fuels when we should be embracing sustainable sources of energy.
"Let me be very, very clear – it’s time to tax the rich."
"Here is our new year’s resolution. Like the thousands of workers who stood up and fought courageously in 2021, we will do the same. No one individual is going to save us. We must rise up together."
Do you have a personal story to share about your or your family’s struggle to get by in today's economy? We want to hear from ordinary Americans who have experienced in their daily lives the consequences of an economy that leaves far too many behind.
"While some drug companies have made billions each year in profits, not one of them has been held fully accountable for its role in an epidemic that is killing tens of thousands of Americans every year. That has got to change."
"Tens of millions of Americans will soon lose their $600-a-week unemployment benefits. The result: More desperation, hunger and evictions. . . Congress must act. At this unprecedented moment in American history, we cannot turn our backs on the working families of this country."
"If that were the case, I can assure you the Koch brothers, Trump and other billionaires would not be pushing so hard for this plan."
"I agree with @Ilhan. We must counter Trump's racist playbook by advancing policies that unmistakably improve working people’s lives, like strengthening collective bargaining, raising the minimum wage, and treating jobs and health care as human rights."
"Millions of Americans are going without work, food and health care.. . Trump's response: Eviscerate the Endangered Species Act so that fossil fuel CEOs can more easily pollute our air and water.. . How absurd is that?"
It's a simple question: Should we listen to the majority of the American people who say they oppose spending more money on the military or should we listen to the lobbyists from the military industrial complex?
"Today is Native American Women’s Equal Pay Day, which marks how long a Native woman has to work into 2019 to catch up to the same amount a white man made in 2018. We must continue the fight for pay parity. This is not a radical issue, this is an issue of fairness and justice."
"It is Congress, not the president, which has the constitutional responsibility for making war. The international community must uphold the prohibition against the use of chemical weapons, but it is unclear how Trump's illegal and unauthorized strikes on Syria achieve that goal."
"I don't know what ""meeting in the middle"" means when scientists say we only have a few years to address climate change or face irreparable harm..  . Of course I want to work with Republicans—but we have got to aggressively respond to the enormous crises facing working families."
It is completely unacceptable for a quid pro quo regarding personal political goals to determine the conduct of U.S. foreign policy..  . The House should continue its impeachment inquiry and expose the full nature of the most corrupt presidency in modern history.
"Wealth inequality is a profound moral issue this country must address. The richest 3 Americans cannot continue owning more wealth than the bottom half of our country, while over 40% cannot afford the basics to live."
We will hold a live streamed town hall Monday Dec. 3 at 7 PM to discuss the crisis of climate change and how we solve it. More info here:
Trump's handpicked Postmaster General—who just happens to be his major campaign contributor and investor in USPS competitors—is trying to sabotage the Postal Service.. . He should either resign or be removed from office. Immediately.
"Don't you feel grateful? The world’s most expensive drug is coming out—$2-3 million a pop.. . $69 billion in annual profits were just not enough for Big Pharma.. . BioMarin should lose its patent monopoly for this price-gouging. Under our legislation, it will."
"If Amazon workers in Alabama – a strong anti-union state – vote to form a union, it'll be a shot heard around the world. If they can negotiate higher wages & better working conditions in the South, it'll benefit every worker in America. Thank you, Mr. President, for speaking out."
"As bad as the pandemic has been for the overall economy, it has been far worse for Black and Latino workers. During the pandemic, nearly 60% of Latino families and 55% of Black families have either experienced a job loss or a pay cut. Congress must act NOW."
Martin Luther King Jr. was a nonviolent revolutionary. It is up to us to follow in his footsteps and carry forth his mission to abolish racism and poverty. #MLK50 #IAM2018
"I won't vote for any spending bill if we do not pass a Dream Act and guarantee that the 800,000 beautiful DREAMers in America are allowed to stay in the only country they know as home."
"Yesterday, I was on the Senate floor to discuss climate catastrophes are happening all over the world and why we must not make it easier for the fossil fuel industry to destroy our planet. If you missed it, tune in."
"30,000 Toys ""R"" Us workers across the country are losing their jobs. This is what happens when you have a system that allows private equity firms to destroy profitable businesses and throw workers out on the streets with no severance."
"Anybody with any sense can understand the point of Trump's tax scam. As more and more wealth and power concentrates with the rich and the large corporations, less and less power rests with the average American worker."
"On Monday, Dec. 3 at 7 p.m. we're holding a national town hall on climate change, an issue that does not get nearly enough attention in the mainstream media. Let's go forward to protect the planet and create millions of good-paying jobs."
"We must stop family separation; reunite families that have been separated; end detention of families, children and anyone who doesn't pose a danger; eliminate private detention facilities; and protect asylum seekers. We also must oppose Trump's nightmarish mass-deportation plans."
Insurance companies made nearly $1 trillion in revenue last year while 87 million Americans went uninsured or underinsured..  . The insurance industry maximizes profits by denying people care..  . We need Medicare for All to make health care a universal human right in America.
"I voted YES. Unlike Trump, today's bipartisan vote made it clear that a majority of the U.S. Senate believes in our Constitution and the separation of powers. It is Congress, not the president, who has the power to take this country into war, and that's what this vote was about."
"Call me a radical, but I happen to believe that rail workers are entitled to paid sick leave."
"His successor must stand against corruption and Wall Street-imposed austerity to help the island recover from decades of economic devastation and Hurricane Maria. Together, we will ensure the full support of the federal government in the rebuilding and recovery of Puerto Rico."
"I thank my friend @JoeBiden for joining our effort to end U.S. involvement in the Saudi military campaign in Yemen, which, over four years of war, has experienced the world's worst humanitarian crisis. We must override. @realDonaldTrump's veto."
"The West Coast is on fire, the color of the sky turned red, the air in many parts of the U.S. is dangerous to breathe, there are 5 simultaneous tropical cyclones in the Atlantic, an 800-mile derecho destroyed Iowa towns. And yet they ask: How can we afford the Green New Deal?"
Jane and I are saddened by the passing of Sen. Mike Gravel. He was dedicated to ending forever wars and bringing more Americans into the political process. His courage will be deeply missed. Our thoughts are with his loved ones.
Today I am in Puerto Rico to talk with families and local government representatives about the destruction they are dealing with.
"Congratulations to the UK’s grassroots activists for successfully banning fracking. We know fracking contaminates our water. We know it pollutes the air we breathe. We know it fuels climate change. . . Together, we can—and we will—ban fracking in America, too."
Listen to @RepDebDingell. Social Security must be protected at all costs. We are not going to leave our fellow Americans behind.
"Racist redlining denied wealth to generations of Black Americans..  . Today, the fossil fuel industry dumps its pollution on communities of color..  . This comment from Trump’s Energy Secretary is disgusting."
"At a time when many workers feel like cogs in a machine, Vermonters should be proud that at places like Switchback Brewing Company our state is helping to lead the country toward alternatives to corporate ownership."
"Victor Orban is undermining democracy in Hungary, just as Donald Trump is in the United States. The job of the President of the United States should be to stand up for democratic values, not embrace leaders who reject them."
The top 1% now has more wealth than the entire middle class. Does that make sense to anyone?.  . Yes. It’s time for Congress to take on the greed of the billionaires and deliver for the working class of this country.
"Nearly 20,000 Amazon workers contracted coronavirus, while Jeff Bezos continues to deny paid sick leave and hazard pay to his workforce.. . How did Mr. Bezos, the wealthiest man alive, do during this pandemic? He increased his wealth by $85 billion since March. Truly disgusting."
"I am concerned that despite some very good provisions in the VA MISSION Act, it continues a trend toward the slow, steady privatization of the VA. I will vote against it."
"“When you come in our Walmart doors now you start at $11 an hr... I don’t make $15 an hour and I’ve been there 18 years. There’s something wrong with that in our country.” –Cynthia Murray, Walmart employee #CEOsvsWorkers"
"One of the great crises we face is the rise of authoritarianism. Whether it's Putin, Trump, Duterte or Viktor Orban in Hungary, we are seeing attacks against freedom of the press, democratic election laws and an independent judiciary."
"Today I am thankful for the people who are making the choice to build a more just and equitable food system in this great country. Working together, I know we can achieve it."
"We talk about being a divided nation. In many ways, that’s true. But, in some ways, we are absolutely united. For example, we all hate the drug companies."
Canadians tell Americans the truth about health care wait times in Canada:
"In the midst of our cold winters, one of the outdoor pleasures for many Vermonters is ice fishing. Recently, my team went out on the ice to hear from some Vermonters about why they love the sport. I hope you'll enjoy hearing what they had to say."
"More corporate greed. While the cost of healthcare is soaring & over 70 million are uninsured or under-insured, 7 health insurance companies made $43.8 billion in profits in the first half of 2022 while spending over $12 billion on stock buybacks. Yes. We need Medicare for All."
"To afford a two-bedroom apartment, a worker making the federal minimum wage would need to work 122 hours a week. The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage and that has got to change."
"We can and must protect our country from the serious potential of another terrorist attack without living in an Orwellian world where the government and private corporations can make warrantless searches of Americans' calls, emails and texts."
Congratulations to the 47 states and localities that are raising the minimum wage today—the largest number of jurisdictions in history.
Our job: Demilitarize police departments so they do not look like oppressing armies.
Join me tomorrow night for the first-ever national town hall on Medicare for All.
"While labor productivity has more than doubled since the late 1960s, nearly half of all new income generated in the U.S. since 1993 has gone to the top 1 percent.. . This is what we mean when we say the economy is rigged in favor of the wealthy."
"This is what our government is paying to develop a COVID19 vaccine:. . - $1.2 billion to AstraZeneca. - $483 million to Moderna. - $500 million to Johnson & Johnson. - $30 million to Sanofi. . Once a vaccine is approved by the FDA, it must be available to all for free. No profiteering."
Americans won a major victory. We've stopped another disastrous Republican bill. Now we must go forward and guarantee health care to all.
"In the richest country in the history of the world, mothers should have a right to spend time with their newborns. We must enact paid family and medical leave NOW."
"The Budget Committee tomorrow at 11 a.m. will hold a hearing on the cost of inaction on climate change. But it won't be Big Oil who pays the price. If we do nothing, climate change will push millions into extreme poverty, disproportionately in communities of color."
"In order to address the long-neglected needs of the working class and combat the existential threat of climate change, we proposed a $6 trillion bill. $3.5 trillion is already a compromise."
"Now on the panel: @CindyEstrada174, Vice President of United Auto Workers, talking about the decline of the middle class over the last 30 years. #InequalityTownHall"
It’s bad enough that the Koch brothers are able to spend unlimited amounts to buy politicians as a result of Citizens United. But to allow them to deduct the dark money they spend to influence the political process is beyond absurd.
"How absurd is it that Social Security has lifted 22 million Americans out of poverty and is among the most popular government programs in existence, but Republicans still want to cut it? Sorry, GOP, but our job is not to cut Social Security. Our job is to expand it."
I'll be on the floor of U.S. Senate TONIGHT at 8pm ET to talk about why we must end the filibuster and protect the constitutional right to have an abortion.
"From the first days of this country, Native Americans were lied to, their treaties violated and their rights ignored. Today on #IndigenousPeoplesDay, we recommit to stand with them in the fight for justice and dignity."
"We are dealing with a crisis of inequality and that is why we must start making the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes, not give more breaks to those at the top."
This Canadian doctor can't believe how complicated and dysfunctional our health care system is:
"Some CEOs get paid more than 1,000 times their typical employee. Most Americans think the ratio should be 7 to 1.. . If American corporations can't align closer with American values, then we are going to tax outrageous CEO pay until they do."
"Up to 20% of incarcerated people in America are imprisoned because they lack the money to pay cash bail or fines for minor violations..  . Let me say that again. Some 400,000 people are incarcerated today for crimes they haven't been convicted of. That is insane."
For too many years the government has been there for the wealthy and the powerful. Now is the time for the government to be there for the working families of this country.
"Now that the President has submitted his budget plan, it is up to Congress to review it, pass the proposals that make sense and improve upon it."
"The Lower Drug Costs Now Act goes after Big Pharma's greed and makes important investments in community health centers and dental care for those on Medicare. @USProgressives are fighting to make this bill even stronger, and I support their efforts."
The Republican budget is disgraceful. Millions will lose health care and thousands will die in order to give tax breaks to billionaires.
"If the Federal Reserve can inject a trillion and a half dollars into the banking system, then Congress can say to the American people: ""We have got your back. If you lose your job, then you will not lose income. You will be made whole."" #saveworkers"
"The original vision of Medicare was to provide quality health care coverage to our nation’s seniors. @RepJayapal and I believe we must lower the eligibility age for Medicare to at least 60 and expand benefits to include dental, vision and hearing coverage."
I cannot understand why Donald Trump would attack a man of incredible integrity and courage like John McCain. #HealthCareDebate
"The key issue of our time is the movement toward oligarchy, where a few billionaires control much of the economy."
We hear all the time from @realDonaldTrump that the economy is booming. What about the millions of workers still struggling just to get by? #CEOsvsWorkers
Our next town hall on Monday night will address the consequences of President Trump pulling the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal. Tune in on Facebook Live:
"Today on #InternationalWomensDay—and every day—we must commit to building a country and world where all women are safe, have equal opportunity and the social, racial and economic justice they deserve. We will not go backward on women's rights. We will move forward."
"No family should have to fight their insurance company over a $2,000 bill for coronavirus treatment.. . Our legislation says: We will lift this burden off your shoulders. Medicare will cover all out-of-pocket medical costs for the duration of this crisis."
Let’s be absolutely clear about what Republicans are doing by adding new paperwork and requirements to Medicaid: they are attacking the poor and threatening lives.
"Dr. David Shulkin, who has just been fired by Trump as Secretary of the VA, is right. We must not allow the VA to be privatized. Our job is to strengthen the VA, not dismember it."
"Cost of public college tuition:. . Germany: $0. France: $0. Sweden: $0. Norway: $0. Finland: $0. Brazil: $0. United States: $10,486. . In the richest country in the world, yes, we must make public colleges and trade schools tuition-free and cancel all student debt."
"While thousands of Americans die each year because they lack access to health care they need, the top five health insurance companies last year made $21 billion in profits. . . We need a health care system that works for all, not just the wealthy."
"4) The Congress must make it clear that we will not accept any interference with the ongoing investigation of Special Counsel Mueller, such as the offer of preemptive pardons or the firing of Rod Rosenstein, and that the president must cooperate with this investigation."
"Big banks are making record profits by charging sky-high interest rates & fees. Unacceptable. If we're going to rebuild the middle class, we must significantly reduce consumer debt. I will be reintroducing my bill to end Wall Street greed & cap credit card interest rates at 15%."
"We are dealing with an eviction crisis in America. Millions of families, even working full time, can't make rent.. . Living wages and dignified housing are universal human rights. In the world's richest country, we ought to start treating them that way."
"I want to congratulate the pharmaceutical industry. While 1 out of 4 Americans can't afford to fill their prescriptions, and over 25% of diabetics ration insulin, the industry made over $50 billion in profits last year and the top 10 CEOs made $500 million. Greed. Greed. Greed."
"Congress must pass legislation to protect Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation, demand that Acting AG Whitaker recuse himself from overseeing the probe based on his previous statements and only confirm a new attorney general who vows to protect Mueller's investigation."
"Equal pay for equal work: women want that whole damn dollar, not 79 cents on the dollar."
"If Eddie Lampert has enough money to buy a $130-million, 288-foot yacht, he damn well has enough money to pay the $43 million severance package he promised to the workers at Sears, whose jobs were destroyed as a result of his greed and mismanagement."
President Trump’s refusal to certify the Iran deal is the latest in a series of reckless moves that make Americans less safe.
"Join me and @GillibrandNY as we introduce the Postal Banking Act. Together, we will guarantee basic banking services to all—no outrageous fees or interest rates—all at your local post office."
"The $740 billion military budget is not enough for Senate Republicans. Now they want to give the Pentagon an additional $21 billion. . . Instead of making the CEOs of defense contractors richer, we should provide every working class American $2,000 a month until this crisis ends."
Congratulations to @GovMurphy and the New Jersey state legislature for agreeing to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. This is a major step forward for economic justice. Our job now: pass $15 minimum wage legislation for ALL Americans.
"Unless we take bold action to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and take on the climate crisis, our children and grandchildren are going to look back on this period in history and ask a very simple question: ""Where were they?”"
The American people are increasingly disgusted with a government that protects the interests of the wealthy and the powerful. We must pass a budget agreement that addresses the needs of Americans and not just billionaire campaign contributors.
Amazon just announced that they made $2.5 billion in profits last quarter. Why does Jeff Bezos still refuse to treat his workers with respect and dignity?
"Republicans have been trying to overturn Roe v Wade for more than 40 years. Now that they are on the verge of achieving their dream, they are downplaying the consequences. We’re not fooled."
"Our current healthcare system is cruel and dysfunctional. Healthcare is a human right, not a privilege. We need Medicare for All."
Congratulations to LA teachers for leading this country forward to ensure that all our children get a quality education. When we stand together there is nothing we cannot accomplish.
"We do not need to waste billions on an unneeded wall so that Trump can appease right-wing extremists.. . We need to create millions of good-paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure — roads, bridges, water systems, rail and affordable housing."
"I have no problem with Trump negotiating with Kim Jong Un. But while he's meeting with Kim, he's pushed us to the brink of war with Iran, and kept us in the horrific Saudi-led war in Yemen. . . We can't just have photo opportunities. We need real diplomacy."
"Republicans in Congress must now summon the courage to stand up to the racist ramblings of our ""stable genius"" president."
"On the issue of guns, we are not so divided: Over 90% of the public supports universal background checks. .  . @SenateGOP and @realDonaldTrump: the country is demanding action right now. Will you side with the American people or will you just do what the @NRA wants?"
"Pharma giant @GileadSciences lies and cheats, then asks the government for tens of billions of dollars in monopoly profits.. . @AOC and I demand that @uspto reject Gilead's endless greed. No one with HIV should have to die because they can't afford"
"During the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, there should NOT be a tradeoff between survival checks that the working class, seniors, children & the disabled desperately need and emergency unemployment benefits. In the richest country in the world, we must do both."
More than 30% of American families could not pay their July rent and 28 million people could become homeless if we don't act.. . What are the Republicans' priorities during this economic crisis? Passing a $135 billion tax break for their millionaire donors.
Amazon is driving down wages. Here's how:
This is not what Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse are supposed to be about. Disney must pay all of its workers a living wage.
"""To be a good judge and a good umpire, it's important to have the proper demeanor ... to keep our emotions in check."" –Brett Kavanaugh, 2015"
Leader McConnell’s statement is very disturbing and misleading. He conveniently ignores the fact that mandatory spending on domestic programs have been severely cut and that the Defense Department has received tens of billions in OCO funding that isn't capped at all.
"Today I introduced legislation with @NydiaVelazquez that would end unequal treatment of the territories, help Puerto Rico recover from the hurricanes and aid the most vulnerable in our society by providing sustainable economic relief going forward."
"If Target just did it, you can be damn sure @Walmart, owned by the wealthiest family in America, can raise its starting wage to $15 an hour."
"""If you want to understand what a turn of the century 20th century sweatshop looks like, all you've got to do is go to an Amazon warehouse for a day."" -James, former Amazon employee"
Spread the word: today is the LAST DAY of open enrollment to sign up for health insurance. Go to to choose a plan and get covered.
This is the health care crisis no one is talking about. Congress must act immediately to fully fund community health centers.
The White House is scared. They say Medicare for All is the health care version of the Green New Deal. . . Damn right! This is about human rights. And we are going to win this struggle.
Watch this progressive Congresswoman @RepJayapal explain what fair immigration reform means on Fox News:
"When it comes to improving the lives of our people, I hear, “Oh my god, Bernie! The deficit! The national debt!”. . When it comes to military spending, “That’s ok, not a problem.”. . The hypocrisy is extraordinary."
It's an outrage that Senate Republicans are ramming through a radical Supreme Court nominee who will strip healthcare from 23 million Americans during a pandemic while doing nothing to provide economic relief to millions of working-class Americans who desperately need our help.
"In the richest country in the history of the world, medical debt should not exist."
"Now is the time to raise the minimum wage to $15, pull millions out of poverty, and provide small-business support to make it happen.. . Yes. The Democratic Congress can and must fulfill President Biden's promise to the American people.. . Let's get it done."
Today we remember the Parkland students and teachers who lost their lives.. . Thank you to the young people who have courageously led the movement to end gun violence. With your leadership and the strong support of the American people we will pass commonsense gun safety legislation
"As a former chair and longtime member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I’m proud that we are sending the PACT Act to the President’s Desk. It is the most comprehensive expansion of health care for our nation’s veterans in a generation."
"Nonetheless, the American people are demanding that Congress stand up to them and finally lower the outrageous price of prescription drugs by requiring Medicare to negotiate with the pharmaceutical industry."
"We must take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, lower drug prices and use the savings to expand Medicare by lowering the eligibility age and providing dental, hearing and vision care to tens of millions of older Americans."
Trump is a pathological liar. How can we develop rational public policy when we have a president who doesn't know the difference between truth and falsehood? Not a good situation for the most powerful nation on Earth.
"Instead of providing more corporate welfare to billionaires and large corporations, we need to provide more financial relief to the tens of millions of Americans who are hurting like they have never hurt before."
"If the U.S. does not end its involvement in the Saudi-led war, millions of Yemenis may die of famine. It makes me very proud to see our young people organizing together to bring this horrific conflict to an end."
"When I reflect on how this country passed Social Security in 1935 and Medicare in 1965, I think about how much poverty and suffering we ended.. . Our next step is Medicare for All. When we succeed, future generations will appreciate how we made health care a human right in America."
"We must break away from the worldview that suggests everybody should try to become a billionaire—and you can lie, cheat, and steal if your goal is to make billions and not pay attention to the suffering of others."
"How absurd is it that we live in a country where Congress and many states give huge tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations, but fail to provide adequate funding for education?"
"Today, I am proud to join the global call for a People’s Vaccine. The United States must play a leading role in making sure a coronavirus vaccine is available to all people around the world."
Health care workers who risk their lives every day fighting this pandemic are being denied the personal protective equipment they need. . . The Trump administration's response: Ignoring thousands of workers' safety complaints. Beyond outrageous.
"Tonight I asked my question in Trump's impeachment trial:. . President Trump claims there was no quid pro quo in holding back military aid to Ukraine. He has lied more than 16,000 times in office. Why should we believe him?"
Enough is enough.. . We are going to end the disgrace of health care being a privilege for the wealthy. We must pass Medicare for all and make health care a right.
"Hoping for a full recovery for Red Sox great David ""Big Papi"" Ortiz, one of the most outstanding and popular baseball players in recent memory."
Have you worked a minimum wage fast food job? What is it like to try to support yourself or your family? Do you have access to benefits or career opportunities?
Who is helping keep Saudi Arabia’s warplanes in the air as they bomb Yemen—where children are dying of hunger in the worst humanitarian crisis on the planet?. . The United States of America. That has got to stop.
We are going to end the days of billionaires not paying a nickel in federal income taxes.
"Rather than subsidize the insurance industry's profits, we can pursue a simpler, cost-effective, and comprehensive solution for health care.. . For the duration of this pandemic, Medicare should cover all out-of-pocket expenses for all Americans. Here's how:"
We must put an end to the unauthorized and unconstitutional involvement of U.S. Armed Forces in the catastrophic Saudi-led war in Yemen and Congress must take back its authority over war.
"The Congressional Budget Office, run by a Republican, estimated that Medicare for All could save the American people $650 billion each year while Yale estimated that Medicare for All could save 68,000 lives each year."
"The effects of climate change already affect all of us—rural and urban residents, inland and coastal communities alike.. . Let's come together as a nation and mobilize a response as large and serious as the emergency itself. Our future depends on it."
"Getting rid of gerrymandered districts is an important step in the fight against voter suppression, but we must go further. It is past time to restore the Voting Rights Act, expand early voting and implement automatic voter registration."
".@billmckibben, a fellow Vermonter, is a great environmental leader. He is an outstanding writer and organizer. Thanks to Bill, and other leading environmentalists, more and more Americans are fighting to save our planet. Thanks, Bill."
"Trump is depriving 500,000 kids of their school lunches for no damn reason—even after 139 members of Congress warned him not to. . . I cannot begin to understand the casual cruelty that motivates Trump and his billionaire friends to harm vulnerable children like this."
"“As an immigrant myself, I am tired of being called the worst of the worst. I am tired of hearing Mexicans be called rapists or Africans be called vulgarities that I cannot even repeat on this floor.” -@RepJayapal"
"These are very difficult times for working families. But for billionaires and the CEOs of large corporations, times have never been better. I’m LIVE on the Senate floor to explain why."
"We will fight to make it easier, not harder, for workers to join unions in America."
The American people were lied to and misled by the Bush administration into believing that the Iraq war was necessary to prevent another 9/11. And Congress did not challenge them on those claims the way it should have.
.@keithellison has news for the GOP: raising taxes on the wealthy works much better for average Americans than tax breaks for the top 1%.
Yesterday was a good day for Putin and the oligarchs in Russia. But it was a bad day for people in the United States and all over the world who believe in democracy and who are trying to understand what world our idiot president lives in.
"Millions of Americans cannot see well enough to walk across their living room, can’t hear well enough to engage in a conversation, or can’t chew food properly because their teeth are in such bad shape due to the cost of basic care. We must expand Medicare NOW."
"Our job is to rally the entire planet to stand up to the fossil fuel industry, which continues to make huge profits while their carbon emissions destroy the planet for our children and grandchildren. #SandersSAIS"
"This report from Yemen states it tax dollars are being used to starve children in Yemen. Next week the Senate will vote on SJ Res 54, and tell the president and the world that the U.S. must no longer be complicit in this humanitarian disaster."
"Billionaires make their campaign contributions and we have politicians who work for them, not the middle class. #TaxDebate"
"Over 40 years, income per person doubled. But half our people live paycheck to paycheck. Why?. . Because the top 1% captured 45% of new income. And the median hourly wage grew by $2 over 40 years.. . This is a rigged economy. And the working class needs to come together to fix it."
"We must act now to prevent 800,000 Dreamers, young people who were raised in this country, from losing their legal status. Any end of year spending agreement must address the fear unnecessarily caused by Trump's reckless actions, and a clean Dream Act must be signed into law."
"It was true in 1993 and it is true now: the time is long, long overdue for the United States to join the rest of the industrialized world and have a universal health care system."
@MittRomney Every other major country on earth guarantees paid family and medical leave to its workers. Every major country. How come we’re not joining the club of virtually the entire world?
"Our job: Increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour, create up to 15 million good jobs rebuilding America, expand Social Security, enact Medicare for all, and make it easier for workers to join unions."
"If Mr. Bezos wants to go to the moon, wants to go to Mars, wants to go to Saturn, that’s his right. But he does not have the right to ask the taxpayers of this country for $10 billion to help him make his trip to outer space."
"It is unacceptable that across every chronic and acute health condition, people of color fare worse than their white counterparts. Together, we can fight racial bias and repair our broken health care system by passing the Health Equity and Accountability Act and Medicare for All."
Rep. @PeterWelch visited a border patrol “processing facility” in Texas holding hundreds of children. Here is what he saw.
"While we pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and 1 out of 4 Americans can’t afford the medicine they need, the top 15 pharmaceutical executives pulled in more than $470 million in salaries and bonuses last year. Greed. Greed. Greed."
What kind of a country are we if we deny health care to millions of children?
"Greed. Greed. Greed. Since 2008, the median price for new brand name drugs soared from $2,115 to $180,000 while 3 pharmaceutical companies made $54 billion in profits last year. How many more people need to die before Congress has the guts to take on the pharmaceutical industry?"
"Republicans have decided to wage war against access to safe, affordable health care. We cannot go back to the days when women in America did not have the right to control their own bodies. Access to safe and legal abortion is a constitutional right."
"Between 2008 and 2015, General Electric received more in tax credits than it paid in actual taxes and is still in line for a $16 billion tax cut next year."
I want to congratulate everyone who is participating in the #MarchForOurLives today. Congress must have the guts to listen to the vast majority of the American people and not just the NRA.
The time is now to finally address the long-term crises facing the working families of this country.
I want to thank the Biden administration for finding a way to keep people in their homes while states distribute the $47 billion in assistance that Democrats in Congress provided in the American Rescue Plan.
"If this country stands for anything it has got to stand for the right of people to practice their religion, to live their lives without bigotry, without fear and certainly within their houses of worship."
"You want good, clean teeth? Simple: Brush your teeth, floss, and fight for Medicare for All."
"Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at a TV channel in Russia, interrupted a live broadcast with a sign that read “NO WAR. Stop the war. Don't believe the propaganda. They're lying to you here.” She has since been detained. This is an act of incredible courage."
"Is anyone really satisfied with a system that allows for nearly 1 out of 4 Americans to not be able to afford their prescription drugs, while six of the largest pharmaceutical companies make nearly $50 billion in profits? I don’t think so."
Amazon was valued at $1 trillion but pays $0 in federal taxes. So imagine my surprise to find out it didn’t need taxpayers to fork over billions in corporate welfare to create jobs in New York. @AOC and many others fighting for working people were right.
"$16,000,000,000,000. Sixteen trillion, with a ""t."". . That's the estimated long-term economic harm caused by this pandemic.. . @SenSchumer and I have a simple question: Why the hell won't Senator McConnell act like this is a crisis and pass emergency relief NOW?"
Democrats must block any legislation that does not reopen the government. It is absolutely absurd that the first Senate legislation during the shutdown is a bill which punishes Americans who exercise their constitutional right to engage in political activity.
You know what Amazon paid in federal income taxes last year?. . Zero.
"Tim Scott and Ted Cruz love to say the GOP tax plan is about creating jobs, that's nonsense. #TaxDebate"
"The Walton family of Walmart is worth over $160 billion, but low-wage Walmart workers are struggling to get by. Do you think the Waltons have enough money to pay their workers a living wage?"
"No, Mr. Trump, coronavirus will not just “disappear.” We need to pass legislation to fight this pandemic and protect the American people. That means:. . 😷 Masks for all. 🧪 Free testing for all. 💊 Health care for all. 👨‍👩‍👧 Economic security for all"
"The bad news: our president doesn't believe in science.. . The good news: today 1,000 young people stood up to demand that Congress take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system to sustainable energy.. . We're going to win this fight for our people and planet."
Watch this tax expert debunk some of @tedcruz's most outrageous tax theories:
Many international studies point to Finland as the happiest country on Earth. Here’s what Finland’s Ambassador had to say when I asked him why that might be:
"When it comes to health care, education, protecting our environment and rebuilding our infrastructure, Republicans say we simply don't have the money.. . But when it comes to giving tax breaks to billionaires and corporations, the sky is the limit!"
"Given the reality that we have a president who believes he is above the law, Congress must continue its investigations. If the House Judiciary Committee deems it necessary, I will support their decision to open an impeachment inquiry."
"My bill to tax 60% of the wealth gains billionaires made during the pandemic would increase Trump's taxes by $240 million & provide healthcare to all. Instead, Trump paid just $750 in taxes & received 100% government funded healthcare he ridicules as ""socialized medicine."" Sad."
"The United States must lead the world in transforming our energy system by moving aggressively to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. When we do that, we protect the planet, create jobs and save consumers money."
"Another pipeline exploded, this time in British Columbia. And yet another community is now in danger. We must imediately transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy."
President Trump's effusive remarks about Kim Jong Un are just the latest example of his very troubling affinity for authoritarians.
Even a Koch brothers-funded attempt to trash Medicare for All can't hide the truth: Medicare for All will lead to a $2 TRILLION REDUCTION in national health expenditures over 10 years. . . That’s trillion with a “T.”
"There is no rational reason why Medicare pays nearly three times more than Medicaid and about twice as much as the VA for the same exact medicine, but that’s exactly what the CBO just found. . . Congress must end this national embarrassment."
"The Parkland students went through an unbelievably traumatic experience. But because they are prepared not just to mourn, but to stand up and fight back, I think it's possible we are going to see real change."
"We have a racist criminal justice system that costs us billions of dollars, ruins lives and allows private prisons to profit off of human misery. It's time for real criminal justice reform."
I thank these 100 scholars for supporting our College For All Act. Young people face lower living standards than their parents enjoyed. We must act boldly and decisively to wipe out student debt and make education a right—and Wall Street will pay for it.
"According to media reports, Democratic negotiators are working on a repeal of the SALT deduction cap for up to five years, which would cost $475 billion and give the richest 5% $400 billion in tax cuts."
My greater concern is if Republicans acquit President Trump by undercutting the very rule of law. That will truly be remembered as a sad and dangerous moment in the history of our country.
"Despite GOP efforts to sabotage health care for millions of Americans, the Affordable Care Act is still the law.. . Spread the word: You can sign up for health insurance today. Open enrollment runs until December 15. Go to to choose a plan and get covered."
"I stand with 100 grassroots organizations demanding that the U.S. end its suspension of @USAID aid to Yemen. During this horrific humanitarian crisis, we should end our military support to Saudi Arabia instead.. . Yemen needs food, medicine, and health care—not bombs and blockades."
"In Denmark, the average worker in McDonald's makes $22 an hour, receives 6 weeks of paid vacation, 1 year of paid family leave, life insurance and a pension. Yes. If McDonald's workers in Denmark can have a decent standard of living, we can do it in the U.S. #McDonaldsStrike"
"Many of my colleagues, day after day, talk about how deeply concerned they are about the deficit and the national debt. They tell us that we just don’t have enough money to expand Medicare, to guarantee paid family and medical leave, and to address the climate crisis."
"If the richest Americans do not start paying their fair share of taxes, we are headed for a future where they control all of the wealth and the rest of the country has none. All of it.. . To me, that is outrageous and that is not what America is about."
Raising the minimum wage is not just about economic justice – it is also about racial justice and gender equality. Black and Hispanic women are more than twice as likely as White men to make less than $15 an hour. We must end starvation wages in America.
"As part of our corrupt, big-money dominated political system, Big Pharma is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on lobbying, campaign contributions and television ads because they want Americans to continue paying, by far, the highest prices in the world for medicine."
"College athletes are workers. It is long past time they be treated like it. That means fair wages, safe working conditions, health care, owning their name and image, and collective bargaining rights."
Let's not forget that the middle class was built by organized labor. I am very concerned to see that @BuzzFeed still hasn't recognized the union formed by its newsroom employees. Our Workplace Democracy Act will put an end to corporations getting away with these stalling tactics.
President Trump's veto of our bipartisan resolution to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen is a very serious challenge to Congressional authority that demands a response. We must vote to override his veto.
"Kate and her family would not have been able to grow their organic farm without the help of the Children's Health Insurance Program. If Congress does not get its act together, 9 million children in working families will lose their health insurance."
It is really a disgrace that the major TV networks constantly ignore climate change or give climate deniers a platform. That is exactly why I brought together some of the greatest climate experts in the world to do what the mainstream media won't do.
"Income and wealth inequality is a profound moral issue this country must address. The richest 2 Americans cannot continue owning more wealth than the bottom 40% of our country, while millions of working Americans cannot afford the basic necessities to live."
"Today, workers in Washington, DC will get paid at least $15 an hour. This is what happens when workers raise their voices, organize and demand to be heard. It’s time for Congress to raise the minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour for all workers."
Starting soon at the Inequality in America National Town Hall
"50 years ago today Martin Luther King Jr. delivered a speech in Memphis, Tennessee as he stood in solidarity with sanitation workers who were on strike for better wages and working conditions. Listen to the speech here:"
"When Republicans want to add some $100 billion to military spending over the next two years we will not turn our backs on working families, the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor. We must have parity between defense and non-defense spending."
"Trump correctly talked about the need to address the opioid crisis. Well, I say to him, you don’t help people suffering from opioid addiction by cutting Medicaid by $1 trillion. We need to expand, not cut Medicaid. #BernieResponds"
"Our thoughts today are with the victims of the horrific shooting at the Capital Gazette yesterday, their families and their colleagues."
What happened at Amazon is a big step forward for workers across the nation. I want to thank the many hundreds of workers at Amazon fulfillment centers all across this country who contacted us and spoke up.
"It may be a radical idea to some of my Senate colleagues & in the editorial rooms of newspapers owned by Rupert Murdoch & Jeff Bezos, but I do believe the future of the planet is more important than the short term profits of the fossil fuel industry. Defeat the Big Oil side deal."
The Trump budget is just the Republican three-step dance. My friend @RepJayapal breaks it down.
"Now is the time for majority rule in the Senate. We must end the filibuster, pass sweeping voting rights legislation, and protect our democracy."
"We are living at this moment in the most difficult time of our lives. Meanwhile, billionaires have never had it better."
"Rep. Tlaib is exactly right. And if these corporations insist on paying their CEOs hundreds of times more than their workers, we will tax them at rate high enough to fund the creation of 230,000 clean energy jobs."
The House Judiciary Committee is doing the right thing by voting to hold Mr. Barr in contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena. No Attorney General is above the law. Mr. Barr must testify—the American people have a right to know.
"5) @swoolhandler and @awgaffney have found that even though the Mercatus study “grossly underestimates the main sources of savings” from Medicare for All, the “central finding” from the study is that it saves Americans $2 trillion over a decade."
"This week, as part of the reconciliation bill, I will be offering an amendment to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour."
"I always find it curious that ""conservatives"" tell us how much they want to get the government off the backs of the people. But when it comes to women and family planning, they want to the government to tell every woman in America what she can and cannot do with her body."
Build Back Better is an enormously important piece of legislation. The American people have a right to know what's in it.
Why are we the only major country on earth not to guarantee paid sick leave to our workers?. . We shouldn't need a global pandemic to recognize that an injustice against low-wage workers is an injustice to us all.
"Am I supposed to be impressed that a billionaire went to space while he’s paid zero in federal income taxes some years and the workers at his company struggle to afford their medical bills, rent, and food for their kids? Nope. It’s time to invest in working people here on Earth."
The most radical thing we can do when it comes to climate change is nothing. We MUST act.
We know we have a very serious problem when we pay far more than any other country in the world for the exact same prescription drugs.
Young people have already demonstrated that they can take on powerful fossil fuel companies and force politicians to answer their call to action. . . To the more than 1 million people walking out for climate justice today: I stand with you.
We are the only major country not to guarantee paid medical leave—that is beyond pathetic. We need to provide it for every worker in America.
It is unacceptable to me that seniors in the richest country on earth cannot afford the hearing aids or the eyeglasses they need to hear and see their grandchildren.
"Scott Pruitt was the worst EPA administrator in the history of the agency. Not only has he acted, time and time again, in an unethical manner, but he has led the agency in exactly the wrong direction."
"There is something fundamentally wrong when thousands of Amazon workers are on food stamps while their boss, Jeff Bezos, is the richest man in the world."
"This week, I had the chance to speak with the Finnish Ambassador and I asked him what can the U.S. learn from Finland? You can watch our full conversation here:"
"At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, and when workers have little power on the job, I applaud the pro-union Amazon workers in Alabama for their courage and willingness to stand up for their rights. They’ve inspired workers everywhere."
"Last week in Philadelphia I joined @Krasner4DA, @KeeangaYamahtta, @premaldharia and @DanielDenvir to address the crisis of mass incarceration and how we can achieve real criminal justice reform. Listen here:"
"The greed of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Citigroup and BlackRock is insatiable. Who cares if the Saudis are starving millions of Yemeni civilians or that our planet faces a climate emergency? Profiting off of $1.5 trillion in Saudi oil is just too important."
I'd love to hear anyone in the Congress tell me they can live on $7.25 an hour. Guess what? They can't! It is time to raise the minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour.
"The great economic crisis we face is the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality. When so few have so much, and so many have so little, a handful of billionaires end up controlling our economic and political life. That has got to change."
"Congress should be working 24 hours, 7 days a week until we pass a bill that provides emergency assistance to the American people in their time of need.. . That bill must include $1,200 direct payments to working-class individuals, $2,400 for couples and $500 for kids."
"Today, in America, just three Wall Street firms – BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street - manage $22 trillion in assets. These three firms are major shareholders in more than 96 percent of S&P 500 companies. Obscene."
LIVE: The Senate Budget Committee is holding a hearing to discuss how President Biden's budget proposal responds to the major crises facing our nation.
"The majority of Amazon's 800,000 workers are working in warehouses and are worried about their safety.. . We should ask Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man, if he can afford to guarantee paid sick leave, hazard pay and safe conditions to all of his workers."
"I stand with St. Paul teachers striking for good pay, benefits, and more resources for students.. . Our teachers should be the best-paid in the industrialized world, not among the worst-paid.. . We must change our national priorities and invest in education."
"If Disney can afford to lavish its CEO, Bob Iger, with hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation, it can and it must pay all of its workers a living wage. Iger should face his workers tonight."
"The ""Inflation Reduction Act"" is a very small step forward. Standing together we can do better. We must do better. Tune in to hear what I said on the Senate floor this weekend."
"Why is Congress busy worrying about the needs of huge financial institutions, but ignores the concerns of ordinary Americans? The answer is simple. Follow the money."
Congress must reassert its constitutional responsibility over war. The Senate and House must vote to immediately defund unauthorized military action against Iran.
The average cashier at McDonald's would have to work for 895 years to make what the company's CEO makes in one year. #CEOsvsWorkers
The time is now for Congress to finally listen to the American people and not the wealthy and large corporations..  . 65% of Americans support raising taxes on large corporations. Let’s do it.
Amazon made $16.8 billion in profits over the past two years but have paid ZERO in federal income taxes. In fact it got a $269 million tax refund.. . Our job: Demand large corporations pay their fair share in taxes so that we can rebuild the disappearing middle class.
"My staff went to the offices of my Senate colleagues to share a new UN report showing that 233,000 people will die as a result of the Saudi-led war in Yemen by 2019..  . If we override Trump's veto of our resolution and end U.S. support for this war, we can save thousands of lives."
"The system is worse for Black people and Native Americans, who own less than 4% of farms in the U.S. and are more than twice as likely to be food insecure than the U.S. as a whole. Racial injustice in the food system—that is a political choice."
We 're talking about many thousands of people with disabilities who will die because they couldn't get their claims processed in a timely manner by an underfunded and understaffed Social Security Administration.
"Let me say it again. You can’t be a political party that talks about demanding the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, and then end up with a bill that gives large tax breaks to millionaires. You can’t do that. The hypocrisy is too strong. It’s bad policy, it’s bad politics."
"As Chairman of the Budget Committee, I believe that NOW is the time to address the long-term crises facing working families. And, yes. We can pay for many of these proposals by demanding that the wealthy and large corporations start paying their fair share of taxes."
"How can Trump not talk about the fact that in a highly competitive global economy, hundreds of thousands of bright young people are unable to afford to go to college, while millions of others have come out of school deeply in debt? #BernieResponds"
"It makes no sense for young people to be denied jobs because they were arrested for smoking marijuana. It is time to decriminalize marijuana, expunge past marijuana convictions and end the failed war on drugs."
Trump's decision to shut down the government is just the latest example of a destructive pattern. The time is long overdue for congressional Republicans to stand up to him.
"On this Fourth of July, let us recommit to building a future that works for all of us, not just the few."
I wish Paul Pelosi a quick recovery from this heinous attack. Violence must have no place in American politics. I hope we can all come together to condemn the increasingly violent rhetoric we hear every day.
Why does Trump's health secretary care more about protecting the profits of the drug industry than the lives of Americans who can’t afford the highest prescription drug prices in the world?
"In 1965, half of seniors over the age of 65 had no medical insurance. The passage of Medicare 56 years ago today ended that injustice. . . Now is the time to lower the Medicare eligibility age to at least 60 and expand the program to include dental, vision, and hearing care."
"""This is not America first. This is America alone."" –@SuzanneDiMaggio #BernieTownHall"
"But we must learn the lessons of the past and not be in the business of regime change or supporting coups—as we have in Chile, Guatemala, Brazil & the DR. The US has a long history of inappropriately intervening in Latin American nations; we must not go down that road again. 3/3"
Join me NOW: I urge my colleagues to stop pouring billions of dollars into wars and weapons.. . President Eisenhower and Dr. King were right. We need the guts to say NO to the military industrial complex and start focusing on real human needs.
Congress must assert its important responsibility over foreign policy and serve as a check on this unstable president.
"Purdue Pharma used its wealth, power, and army of lawyers to bully West Virginia officials and get away with murder. . . Who has to live with the consequences of opioid executives' greed? Thousands of innocent kids now in foster homes and emergency shelters."
"Three people own more wealth than the bottom half of our country. 25 hedge fund managers earn twice as much as all 140,000 kindergarten teachers. One family (Kochs) spent $400 million to buy elections. That's why we need a political revolution."
Here’s my message to the 16% of Americans who approve of the job Congress is doing.
"Trump thinks we have ""the greatest economy in the history of America."" It may be great for his friends at Mar-a-Lago, but:. . -The average worker makes less today than 43 years ago. -80% live paycheck to paycheck. -43% of households can't afford basic needs"
"This is sickening. We have seen a terrible level of police violence against unarmed African Americans: Sandra Bland, Rekia Boyd and now Pamela Turner. We need an investigation of this shooting and immediate reform to our racist criminal justice system."
Let me thank @SenSchumer for his support for my amendment to cut the bloated $740 billion Pentagon budget by 10% and invest $74 billion in communities that have been ravaged by extreme poverty and mass incarceration. This amendment will begin to change our national priorities.
"The loan sharks of today wear expensive suits and work on Wall Street, where they make hundreds of millions of dollars by pushing sky-high fees and outrageous interest rates as high as 27 percent on American consumers. Together, we must end their greed."
"Let us hope that the ceasefire in Gaza holds. But that's not enough. Our job now is to support desperately needed humanitarian and reconstruction aid to Gaza’s people, and find a way to finally bring peace to the region."
"Philadelphia police stopped 25,000 cars because they ""smelled marijuana."" . . 84% were African American drivers. They found marijuana only 12% of the time.. . Our job must be to end the War on Drugs—and get racial bias out of law enforcement at the same time."
"I am proud to stand with @AOC and @repblumenauer today to announce our resolution declaring a climate emergency. . . If Trump insists on denying the reality of climate change, Congress must act to mobilize America and defeat this existential threat."
"It's a travesty that the Supreme Court upheld Ohio’s voter suppression efforts. Instead of making people jump through hoops to vote, states should pass automatic voter registration and same-day registration. Politicians afraid of large voter turnouts are political cowards."
"In my view, it would be insane to argue that our criminal justice system is not racist, broken, and in need of serious reform."
Medicare is the most popular health insurance program in the country. #MedicareForAll
"Donald Trump and his advisers believe in huge tax breaks for billionaires, but when it comes to raising wages for workers they actually want to abolish the minimum wage. . . Too many Americans are forced to work 2 or 3 jobs to survive. We must raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour."
"Loudly and clearly, we must tell Republicans leaders: no, we will not cut Social Security benefits for seniors and disabled veterans."
Here is the simple truth:. . We have a president who is a racist.. A president who is a sexist.. A president who is a homophobe.. A president who is a xenophobe.. And a president who is a religious bigot.. . We have got to confront that truth and reject Trump's bigotry.
"We must end the growing concentration of ownership in agribusiness and fight to preserve and strengthen family based agriculture. The American people deserve high quality, locally grown food."
The United States is the only major country not to guarantee ANY paid maternity or paternity leave. That is a disgrace that has got to change. . . It should not depend upon the generosity of one's coworkers whether a parent is able to be with their newborn baby.
"It is no secret millions of Americans have given up on democracy. They think that we don’t care about working people.. . This week, we not only begin addressing the health and economic crises we face, but—maybe even more importantly—we begin restoring faith in the U.S. government."
"In the midst of a potential rail strike, Warren Buffett, the owner of BNSF Railway's parent company, worth $100 billion must intervene. During the pandemic, Mr. Buffett became $36 billion richer. He must ensure that rail workers receive decent wages and safe working conditions."
"LIVE: Please join my town hall on the coronavirus pandemic with @SenatorLeahy, @PeterWelch, and @GovPhilScott.. . We are answering Vermonters' questions by phone and providing information on federal and state efforts to address this crisis:"
Donald Trump's budget is not only an absolute disaster – full of ideas that the American people have already rejected – it exposes Trump for the fraud that he is.
"The GOP bill to repeal the estate tax would give the Walton family, the richest family in America and the owners of Walmart, a tax break of up to $88 billion. Does anyone really believe that we should be providing an $88 billion tax break to the wealthiest family in the country?"
What kind of message does it send when a defense contractor is paid 100 times more than the secretary of defense? Corporate interests should never take precedence over the interests of taxpayers or our national security.
"To stop the spread of the coronavirus, and to reduce the obscene racial disparities in our criminal justice system, we must take urgent federal action to dramatically reduce the prison population."
"This Labor Day, we celebrate workers and the tireless work of the trade union movement for equal rights and economic justice. Together, we will continue the fight to expand workers’ rights and build an economy based on human needs, not greed."
"Under our profit-driven system, the wealthy can buy vaccines. The poor or working class may get sick or even die.. . Protecting the health of the American people means taking care of everyone—including our most vulnerable.. . We need Medicare for All."
"For whatever reason—you got me, I don't know why—Trump and his administration want to make a bad situation even worse when it comes to health care in this country."
"Please join me, along with workers from Amazon, Disney, McDonald’s, American Airlines and Walmart, for a town hall this Monday night at 7pm where we will discuss something that is never discussed. It will be livestreamed at You don't want to miss it."
"Too many people are risking their lives showing up to work every day.. . I stand with workers as they fight for their own safety.. . Every employer in America must guarantee:. . 🥽 Protective gear. 🧼 Hand sanitizer and soap. ⚠️ Hazard pay. 🏭 A safe, clean workplace. 🛌 Paid sick leave"
"Mayor @CarmenYulinCruz is a doing a great job in standing up for the people of Puerto Rico. How outrageous is it that the president is opposing Puerto Rican statehood, a major decision, simply because of his views on one local leader?"
1.4 million people who work in the health industry have no health insurance at all. Americans are working in hospitals amid a deadly pandemic without any health coverage.. . How insane is that?. . We need Medicare for All.
"While Walmart claims it cannot afford to pay its workers $15 an hour, it was able to find enough money to pay its CEO more than $22 million last year.. . Tomorrow @RepRoKhanna and I will be introducing The Stop WALMART Act to put an end to their outrageous greed."
"When Reagan slashed taxes for the rich in 1981, economic growth went down by 1.9% the following year and the unemployment rate increased. The 1981 tax cut was so ""successful"" that Reagan had to increase taxes 11 times after that."
"How can you have a decent life today when you're barely getting by? This is what our workers ask themselves: 44% are in low-wage jobs averaging $18,000 a year.. . My bill makes $15 an hour the minimum wage, providing relief to 40 million struggling"
"Remember when Mr. Trump promised the typical American family a $4,000 pay raise? That was a lie. . . The average worker has received an increased bonus of just 1 cent an hour since the Trump tax scam was signed into law."
"If we have any sense of morality as a nation, we have got to worry about the 20% of kids who today face hunger and the older people who are isolated, not getting the food they need. Those must be our priorities."
A billionaire shouldn't have any more of a right to run for office than a working stiff who can't afford to raise the millions of dollars needed for a campaign.
Trump and the Republicans' latest attack on women's rights is this gag rule on health providers. Their goal is to overturn Roe v. Wade.. . We will not let them win. We must fight together until a woman’s constitutional right to abortion is truly secure.
SOLVING OUR CLIMATE CRISIS: This is the fight of our lifetimes. Join our national town hall to discuss how we can address the global threat of climate change. #ClimateTownHall
"Trump says he loves business and states' rights. Except when automakers and the state of California worked together to reduce car emissions. . . How sick do you have to be, in the face of a climate emergency, to have your EPA block this effort to cut tailpipe pollution?"
"63 percent of our workers are living paycheck to paycheck during this pandemic. . . Meanwhile, 664 billionaires got $1.3 trillion richer. . . Maybe – just maybe – it’s time to build an economy that works for all."
"On this #EarthDay let's commit to build a sustainable energy future and a healthy, livable planet for all of our kids and grandchildren. That is our moral responsibility."
"2nd Quarter Profits. Exxon: $17.9 billion - highest ever. Chevron: $11.62 billion - highest ever. Shell: $11.5 billion - highest ever. BP: $8.5 billion - highest in 14 years. . The UN Secretary General is right: This ""grotesque greed"" is destroying the planet and punishing the poor."
He took out the essence.
"Corporate greed is Chipotle increasing its profits by 181% last year to $764 million, giving its CEO a 137% pay raise to $38 million in 2020 and blaming the rising cost of a burrito on a minimum wage worker who got a 50 cent pay raise. That's not inflation. That's price gouging."
The allegation from Professor Christine Blasey Ford is a serious one that deserves a full investigation. Neither the Judiciary Committee nor the full Senate should vote on Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court until that takes place.
"The only thing Medicaid work requirements are good at is kicking people off their coverage. . . If the GOP wants to help people find work, they should invest in employment programs and guarantee health care as a right—not punish people who are struggling."
Apply for spring internships in Senator Sanders' Vermont and Washington DC offices. The deadline to apply is October 30. See here for more information:
The clean energy revolution cannot be stopped by politicians in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry. In 10 years:.  . 💨📉Wind energy prices fell 70%. ☀️📉Solar prices fell 90%.  . We will create millions of jobs and save Americans money as we move to a renewable energy economy.
"Banning Congresswomen Omar and Tlaib from entering Israel and Palestine is a sign of enormous disrespect to these elected leaders, to the United States Congress, and to the principles of democracy. The Israeli government should reverse this decision and allow them in."
We need to get our priorities right. Not giving tax breaks to billionaires. Not throwing millions of people off of health insurance. We have got to pay attention to the working families of the this country.
"A rigged economy is Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos becoming $408 billion richer during the pandemic while, in a given year, paying nothing in federal income taxes. Yes, we must demand that the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes and finally create an economy that works for all of us."
Mental health care is a human right—now more than ever.
Republicans should listen to the stories of people like Brenda Dare who need Medicaid to live in dignity.
Can anyone possibly defend taking away lunch from little kids? Would my GOP colleagues care to work with me and @IlhanMN to end these outrageous stories?. . We have a bill that wipes out school lunch debt and makes free school meals universal. Let's pass it.
"We are locking up millions of Americans in cages—disproportionately people of color—but nobody ever asks, ""How are you going to pay for that?"" I wonder why that is."
"Public support for Medicare for All is rising. Why? The reason is pretty obvious. It is getting harder and harder to defend a dysfunctional health care system in which 30,000 people die every year because they don't get to a doctor when they should."
Listen to these Patriotic Millionaires: it's patriotic for the very wealthy and corporations to want to pay their fair share in taxes. with @PatrioticMills
"I am on the floor urging the Senate to provide $1,200 direct payments to all working-class Americans and $500 to their kids.. . Millions are out of work, hungry, and can’t pay rent. The American people need their government to step up and pass this relief."
"The scientists tell us that the future of the planet is endangered by climate change. Meanwhile, because of Trump's government shutdown, about 95% of employees have been furloughed because they are ""non-essential."" How insane is that?"
"CEOs now make over 350 times as much as their average employees..  . Maybe, just maybe, we can create an economy based on human needs, not greed."
Tax the billionaires. Invest in the working class.
"As soon as tomorrow, I will introduce an amendment on the floor of the U.S. Senate to end starvation wages in America. No one can survive on $7.25 an hour."
I stand with @transportworker fighting to keep us safe and to keep airline mechanics jobs in America.
"People are spending most of their stimulus checks on food, medicine and other necessities. We have got to do a lot more.. . Congress must now immediately authorize monthly payments of $2,000 to every person in America until this crisis is over."
"Yesterday, I met with a few brave human rights activists from the Middle East. Here’s what they had to say."
"If we can pass bold legislation NOW that invests in them, we can show the American people that government can work for all of us, and not just the wealthy few."
"Three years ago, 49 people lost their lives in the Pulse nightclub shooting. It is absurd that we have not passed common sense gun safety legislation by now—all because the GOP is in the pocket of the NRA. My thoughts are with those who are remembering their loved ones today."
"That includes a historic expansion of the Child Tax Credit. Starting this week, roughly 39 million households, including 88% of children in the US, will begin to receive a direct monthly child tax credit payment."
Trump has repeatedly reneged on his promises by supporting the wealthy at the expense of working families.
Today my colleagues and I sent a letter to @SecBlinken asking him to urge the Israeli government to make sure that all Palestinians in the occupied territories receive the COVID vaccine.
There is no question that this historic increase in the child tax credit is going to make a real difference in people’s lives. It’s a major reason the ARP is one of the most significant pieces of legislation passed for working people in the modern history of this country.
"Why is it, that in the wealthiest country in modern history, high school students who live four miles apart have radically different access to education?. . This pandemic has laid bare the deep injustices that existed long before the crisis."
This House Republican voted to stop Trump from illegally taking us to war with Iran..  . Standing up for the Constitution is not a partisan issue. Congress must always vote on whether to send our young men and women to war.
We have a rigged tax code that has essentially legalized tax dodging for large corporations. It's time to repeal the Trump tax breaks for the wealthy and large corporations and rebuild the disappearing middle class. #TaxDay
"$5,200,000,000 a day..  . $36,600,000,000 a week..  . $731,800,000,000 in 5 months..  . That's how much the collective net worth of 467 billionaires grew during a pandemic that has cost 30 million jobs and 176,000 lives..  . It's time to tax billionaires and guarantee health care to all."
I'm LIVE on the floor of the U.S. Senate to demand we end the filibuster and protect the constitutional right to have an abortion.
The Mountain Valley Pipeline would generate emissions equivalent to 37 coal plants or putting 27 million more cars on the road. It's hard for me to understand why anyone concerned about climate change would consider voting to approve such a dirty & dangerous fracked gas pipeline.
"The Amazon is being destroyed. So Trump opens America's largest rainforest, Tongass National Forest, to logging and mining. . . Methane emissions surge worldwide. Trump's EPA will make them grow faster.. . The president and his billionaire friends are a threat to our entire planet."
A nurse should not pay more in federal taxes than a billionaire.
"If you think it is too expensive to take care of our veterans, don't send them to war."
What Dr. King's extraordinary vision was all about was building a beloved community.. . Our job is to bring people of all backgrounds together and create a compassionate society in which every single one of us can live with dignity.
"The good news is that the full Congress must and will do far better. At a time when the drug companies are charging us by far the highest prices in the world, Congress must demand that Medicare negotiate prices with this extremely greedy and powerful industry."
"Facial recognition technology violates the privacy and civil liberties of Americans, and deepens racial bias in policing.. . Congress must ban facial recognition technology for all policing."
"Here's the story that Trump failed to mention: since March, the three richest people in America saw their wealth increase by more than $68 billion. Meanwhile, the average worker saw an increase of—are you ready for this—4 cents an hour. #BernieResponds"
"BlackRock, the largest Wall Street investment firm in the world, says today that it will focus on environmental sustainability.. . It can start by ending its investments in destroying the Amazon rainforest. Funding the slashing and burning of our planet's lungs is a disgrace."
"This Labor Day, I stand with my House colleagues. Mitch McConnell: You do not have the right to deprive the American people of a debate to give millions of workers a raise. Bring the Raise The Wage Act to the floor for a vote."
"The founders of Amazon, Facebook & Google increased their wealth by $162 billion during the pandemic, while the companies they control enjoy monopoly power. It's time to break up big tech, tax the wealth of billionaires and create an economy that works for all of us, not the 1%."
Federal income taxes paid last year:. . Nike: $0. . FedEx: $0. . Zoom: $0. . Dish Network: $0. . Salesforce: $0. . Hewlett-Packard: $0. . Kinder Morgan: $0. . Archer Daniels Midland: $0. . Booz Allen: $0. . Charter Communications: $0. . Edison: $0. . Duke Energy: $0. . We must #TaxTheRich
"We must do everything we can to protect our trans brothers and sisters from violence, and we will work every day until hatred and discrimination truly have no place in our society. #TDOR"
"Republicans say, ""We don't want to hurt Medicare."" Then why does their budget cut it by $473 billion?"
"Trump's proposed payroll tax cut would do nothing for the 30 million who lost jobs during the pandemic while taking money away from Social Security.. . Instead, we must extend unemployment benefits, provide $2,000 a month to every working-class American, and expand Medicare to all."
"Millions of people are given excessive parole, probation or sentences, whose lives are destroyed while taxpayers pay millions to lock people up. If we are going to address mass incarceration that has got to change."
"2) Tapper says, “The study’s author says that that $2 trillion drop is not actually his conclusion. He says that’s based on assumptions by Senator Sanders.” Wrong. Provider payment rates in our plan are not assumptions, they are written into the bill..."
"Medicare for All means businesses will not have to worry about how to provide health care for their employees. . . Workers will not be trapped in jobs to keep decent insurance. Instead, they will be able to pursue the work they love, which could be an enormous boon for the economy."
We took some American doctors to Canada to see a universal health care system up close. Here's what they learned:
"In 2002 I voted against the creation of DHS and the establishment of ICE. That was the right vote. Now, it is time to do what Americans overwhelmingly want: abolish the cruel, dysfunctional immigration system we have today and pass comprehensive immigration reform."
"Once again, it is clear that a majority of Americans support an agenda which calls for economic justice. Increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour would give a pay raise to 40 million Americans. Let's do it."
"In the richest country in the world, it is an outrage that college students struggle with hunger every day. Enough is enough. We must eradicate hunger on college campuses."
"LIVE: My colleagues often say they’re concerned about the deficit. Well, if they’re really concerned, let us not give a $76 billion blank check to the highly profitable microchip industry with no protections at all for the American taxpayer."
Fast food workers built a grassroots movement to raise the minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour. Congress must now stand with them and take action. Working people must be able to live with dignity in the richest country in the world.
Child care should not cost parents more than sending their kids to college. We need a revolution in child care in this country.
"Instead of addressing the surge in hunger due to this economic meltdown, the Senate is rushing to pass a $740 billion military budget.. . We need to fundamentally alter our national priorities. It's time to eradicate hunger in America. It's time to increase nutrition support."
"At a time of massive wealth inequality, the GOP estate tax repeal bill would give a $1.7 trillion tax cut to the top 0.1% & NOTHING for the 99.9%. It provides:. . $88B to the Walton family. . $71B to the Bezos family. . $64B to the Musk family. . Just what we need. Totally insane."
".@RepRaulGrijalva is right. We must stand with the people of Puerto Rico in this decisive moment, and make sure their will is not trampled upon by an unelected board making cuts to education and health care."
"Truck drivers deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, not like modern-day indentured servants. That is what we are here in California today to demand."
"On this day, 84 years ago, FDR signed Social Security into law. It is one of the most successful programs in our country’s history and lifts more Americans out of poverty than any other..  . We are not going to cut Social Security—we are going to expand it."
How long will we continue to ignore the destructive forces of climate change? How many more people have to suffer the consequences of our inaction? .  . Enough is enough. We must combat climate change NOW.
Does anyone out there honestly believe that the answer to growing income and wealth inequality is to give more tax breaks to billionaires? That is absurd.
Win Butler of @ArcadeFire sat down with a member of Team Sanders to talk universal health care. See what he had to say:
We've got a government crisis right now. I want to hear your questions:
"It is disgusting that Trump would exploit this pandemic to bust postal unions and privatize the most popular government agency in America.. . If we can bail out large corporations, we can damn well save the Postal Service and protect these essential jobs."
President Trump must allow Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation to continue unimpeded. Any attempt by the president or the Justice Department to interfere with Mueller’s probe would be an obstruction of justice and impeachable offense.
"Elle Purrier St. Pierre, the Montgomery, Vermont dairy farmer, advanced tonight to the women's 1,500-meter semifinal in Tokyo. Congratulations, Elle. Vermont is rooting for you!"
Every police department violating people's civil rights must be stripped of federal funding.
It's confirmed: July was the hottest month ever recorded. . . How insane is it that our Environmental Protection Agency is now run by a former coal lobbyist? We must stand up to the fossil fuel industry and say: you will no longer dictate our climate policy.
"Do you want to know what's crazy? Last year, Amazon and Netflix, to name a couple companies, paid no federal income taxes after making billions in profits."
The legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is not just remembering him. The legacy is for us to follow in his footsteps and transform our country.
"In 2020, the minimum wage in 32 jurisdictions throughout the country will reach or surpass $15 an hour. . . Now it's time to make this a reality everywhere in America."
Fighting for Medicare for all will mean taking on special interests who will spend enormous sums of money to defend our dysfunctional health care system. They have the money. We have the people.
"As a pandemic rages, public health departments across America are being starved and are on the verge of collapse.. . Meanwhile, billionaires have seen their wealth grow by $565 billion.. . That is what oligarchy looks like."
Congress needs to get its act together and pass funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program. Health care for 9 million children is at stake. 9 million children.
"This is the point of canceling student debt and providing free college for all. Education should be treated as a public right, enjoyed by everyone—not a luxury afforded to the few."
"Iran's resumption of work at Fordow is a concerning step. We had a deal in place that capped Iran’s nuclear program, which Trump recklessly violated. We should rejoin the JCPOA immediately and talk to Iran about other regional issues."
"The threats to our democracy could not be clearer, and we must act boldly to protect it."
It is long past time for Congress to take action on gun safety to save innocent lives.
We must do everything we can to protect our democracy and work with allies to do the same.
"In the richest country in the history of the world, close to 600,000 people are homeless during the dead of winter. To my mind, that is immoral."
"Congratulations to @BobbyScott and every Democrat on the @EdLaborCmte for passing legislation to raise the federal minimum wage from a starvation wage of $7.25 an hour to a living wage of $15 an hour.. . A job should lift Americans out of poverty, not keep them in it."
"What Nemiah is doing is admirable, but an 11-year-old should not have to raise money to keep her mother alive in the wealthiest country in the world. Health care must be a right. #MedicareForAll"
Trump and the Republicans are using health insurance for 9 million children as a bargaining chip for a wall that will do more harm than good.
"We need a new moral agenda where the poor and middle-class are lifted up, not left behind."
"Not on our watch. Abortion is a constitutional right—period. To the hypocritical Republicans who claim to love ""small government"": No, we will not let you take away women's constitutional right to control their own bodies."
"One of my great fears is that President Trump, through a combination of arrogance, ignorance and incompetence, will get the United States into another war."
I will do everything that I can as a United States Senator to prevent such a war.
Two-thirds of America thinks the economy is helping the rich and hurting the working class.. . What particularly angers me—and why people have such contempt for Washington—is the corporate control over our political life while the middle class disappears.
"Bills are piling up, rent is due, millions are jobless. A one-time $1,200 check won’t cut it.. . We need to provide $2,000 a month to every man, woman and child—and make it retroactive to cover the past three months.. . If we can bail out corporations, we can ensure everyone’s needs."
"This is a public health crisis: The last remaining clinic in Missouri that provides safe, legal abortion could be shut down within hours. We must fight the extremists who, in state after state, are waging a war against women."
"I stand in solidarity with the University of Vermont staff who are organizing to form a union. When workers unionize and collectively bargain, they gain a strong voice to fight for better employment conditions that benefit us all."
"Trump, a tax dodger who abused and cheated his own workers, has done everything he can to get the government to enrich the billionaire class.. . Any wonder why Amazon gets away with injuring its warehouse employees and paying $0 in federal taxes?"
"The ""radical idea"" of universal health care is a reality in:. . Australia. Austria. Belgium. Canada. Chile. Czech Rep.. Denmark. Finland. France. Germany. Greece. Hungary. Iceland. Israel. Italy. Japan. Netherlands. New Zealand. Norway. Poland. Portugal. S. Korea. Spain. Sweden. Switz.. Turkey. U.K."
Solitary confinement is a form of torture. It is unconstitutional. It has got to be abolished as part of comprehensive reform to our racist criminal justice system.
Pompeo supports the use of torture. He has longstanding relationships with anti-Muslim extremists. And his hawkish views on Iran and North Korea could very well lead us into another disastrous war. I will vote no on his nomination.
This is a rigged economy. CEOs of companies that pay some of the lowest wages in America—often employing essential workers—saw their pay increase by an average of 29% in 2020. . . And the workers? A 2% decrease in pay in 2020. That is absurd.
"Congratulations to Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats for passing the $3.5 trillion Budget Resolution. Now, let us move forward aggressively to transform this country by passing both the Reconciliation Bill and the Infrastructure Bill. Working families are counting on us."
Watch my response to Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.
"Read this piece from @NickKristof about Saudi human rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul, who has been detained and tortured by the Saudi regime. The U.S. must push for rights activists to be freed and the regime held accountable."
"Despite Jeff Sessions' war on marijuana, a growing majority of the American people understand that we should allow states the right to move toward the decriminalization of marijuana, not reverse progress that has been made."
The Supreme Court just allowed Michigan to continue gerrymandering districts to benefit Republicans.. . Our job: Fight back. Expand voter turnout. Make state legislatures and courts end partisan gerrymandering. Overturn Citizens United. Create a vibrant democracy.
"If we could bail out large corporations, please do not tell me that we cannot save the Postal Service."
What are the issues that Americans care most strongly about? The polling is clear.
"Congratulations to Chuck Todd and Meet the Press for holding a serious discussion about climate change. Will this be a breakthrough moment for mainstream TV, which rarely discusses this issue?"
"The people of Yemen desperately need humanitarian help, not more bombs.. . I am disappointed, but not surprised, that Trump has rejected the bi-partisan resolution to end U.S. involvement in the horrific war in Yemen."
Want to understand why workers around the country are standing up and fighting back? Take a look at what JetBlue flight attendants did by joining the Transport Workers Union @transportworker
"8 of the largest drug companies in the United States made nearly $50 billion in profits in 2020, while the CEOs in those pharma giants made over $350 million in total compensation.. . Meanwhile, Americans pay some of the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs."
"Here's what the Trump economy looks like: While 30 million Americans lost jobs, Goldman Sachs doubled its quarterly profits. No. Trump did not ""stop Wall Street from getting away with murder."" He bailed out Wall Street and gave the 6 largest banks a $32 billion tax break."
"It's time to get Jeff Bezos, the Waltons and other billionaires who won't pay a living wage off of welfare. Today I'm introducing legislation to give them a choice: pay workers a living wage, or pay for the public assistance your low-wage workers rely on."
Let me make a prediction: @SenTedCruz is going to tell you that because of tax cuts for the wealthy you will all be rich. That's a lie.
The fight for #NetNeutrality is not over. Today my colleagues and I introduced a bill to undo the FCC's disastrous repeal of net neutrality. We can overturn the FCC's decision but we need your help.
"I remember talking to a young woman in Vermont who left medical school with $300,000 in debt. . . Her crime? She wanted to become a doctor and work with low-income people.. . She shouldn’t be punished with a debt of $300,000. College indebtedness is a horror."
"With tens of thousands of Americans dying and millions losing their jobs, how sad it would be if we learned nothing from all that we have done wrong..  . We must reassess the foundational institutions of American society and determine how we go forward into a better future."
Alec Smith died at 26 because he was rationing insulin that was too expensive. The greed of the pharmaceutical industry is killing Americans and it has got to stop. (with @NSmithholt12)
83% of the American people support empowering the federal government to negotiate with the pharmaceutical industry to lower prescription drug prices. .  . Let’s get it done.
New moms in Denmark: guaranteed 126 days of paid leave.. New moms in Canada: guaranteed 119 days of paid leave.. New moms in France: guaranteed 112 days of paid leave.. . New moms in the United States: guaranteed ZERO days of paid leave.. . We must end this international embarrassment.
"While Trump provided a trillion dollar tax giveaway to the top 1% and profitable corporations, his budget would deny high-quality childcare and early childhood education to nearly 150,000 kids by cutting Head Start by $7.6 billion over the next ten years."
Does single-payer health care mean “government-run” health care? This Canadian doctor breaks down the myth. #MedicareForAll
"As a candidate, Trump said he'd protect Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.. . Now he has an obligation to tell the American people: ""I was lying. It was all just a campaign ruse."""
We must take on the NRA and pass commonsense legislation to keep our children safe.. . . -Tighten background checks. . -End the gun show loophole. . -Crack down on people who buy guns legally for people who can’t. . -Ban civilian sale of semiautomatic assault weapons
"“The proposed tax reform package stakes out America’s bid to become the most unequal society in the world."" – @Alston_UNSR"
Who's pushing Republicans to pass tax cuts for the rich that only 12% of Americans support? Their billionaire
Putin and his oligarch friends have stolen from the Russian people. They have it all while ordinary people are suffering. I have so much respect for the incredibly brave people in Russia who are out on the streets protesting against what their president is doing.
"What the Kochs and other billionaires understand is that if they can destroy the trade union movement in America, it will be even more difficult for workers to earn decent wages and benefits, and the political power of working people will be diminished."
"Since the 1990s, the financial sector has given more than $3.2 billion in campaign contributions, and last year spent over $200 million on lobbying. That is why Congress will be spending day after day trying to make life easier for large financial institutions."
"I've got news for those who thought Mexico was going to pay for Trump's pointless wall. It ain't Mexico who's gonna pay, it's you, the American taxpayer."
The window for meaningful climate action is closing. Our job: come together to take on the powerful fossil fuel industry and mobilize a national response as large and serious as the emergency itself. Our future depends on it.
I stand with Adriana and every McDonald’s worker fighting for a living wage and a union. McDonald’s greed must end.
"Listen to the CEO of Intel tell you all you need to know about oligarchy, corporate arrogance, and the state of American politics. It sure sounds like extortion to me."

The time is long overdue for us to remove the absurd federal prohibition on marijuana.
"The Saudi Arabian regime treats women as third-class citizens, tortures civilians, and now is siding with Putin in the war against Ukraine. Yes, we must pull US troops out of Saudi Arabia, stop selling them weapons, and end its price-fixing oil cartel."
"It is disgraceful that Republicans in Wisconsin and Michigan, having lost on Nov. 6, are trying to decrease the power of incoming Democratic governors Tony Evers and Gretchen Whitmer and limit future voting. This power-grab is pathetic and must be stopped."
"Over the past 9 months, 651 billionaires in America became over $1 trillion richer..  . During the same time, the working class, the elderly and the disabled were told to survive on just a $1,200 check..  . $1 trillion for billionaires. One $1,200 check for the rest. That is immoral."
"Farmers who grew the food we enjoy today only received 12 cents for every dollar spent on Thanksgiving. As agribusinesses get bigger, farmers’ checks get smaller. Allowing massive agribusinesses to push family farmers off the land is a political choice."
We must look at climate change as if it were a devastating military attack against the United States and the entire planet. And we must respond accordingly.

Senate Republicans just passed their tax reform bill. What an utter disgrace.
How does a universal health care system actually work? Hear it from Canadian doctors who have seen it firsthand.
Good. Now let's do every other state and territory in the country.
"It is truly outrageous that Senate Republicans refuse to act as tens of millions lose their jobs, income and health care.. . It’s time to join the rest of the world. Congress must make sure that every worker keeps their paycheck and health insurance until this crisis is over."
Bernie responds to Trump’s Supreme Court pick. Leave your questions for him in the comments:
"While Trump paid just $750 in U.S. federal income taxes in 2017, he has paid:.  . - $188,561 in taxes to China. - $156,824 in taxes to the Philippines. - $145,400 in taxes to India. - $15,598 in taxes to Panama. . And Trump wants us to believe he puts America first? What a hypocrite!"
"Never forget that corporations and their executives profit off of the Trump administration's inhumane immigration policies, along with our system of mass incarceration which locks up 2.2 million people in this country."
"55 of the largest corporations in the U.S. paid no federal corporate income taxes last year, but spent nearly $450 million on lobbying. Outrageous. We must get big money out of politics and create an economy that works for all of us, not just the top 1%."
"Since Trump was elected, the five richest people in America have seen their wealth go up by over $100 billion.. . Over the past year, wages for average workers are up by $9.11 a week after adjusting for inflation.. . That is the economic reality under Trump."
...Any score that replaces Medicare reimbursement rates with some other set of rates is not a score of our plan.
"70% of all voters support #MasksForAll, including 65% of Republicans.. . This is not about partisan politics. Providing free masks to all will bring the virus under control, restart the economy and save lives."
"The historic expansion of the child tax credit, passed earlier this year under the American Rescue Plan, helped lower child poverty in this country by more than 50%. Pretty good. But we cannot stop there. We must extend it now."
The taxpayers of this country should not be providing corporate welfare to the wealthiest families in this country. #BernieResponds
"I agree with Bill Gates. At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, the last thing Congress should do is give huge tax breaks to billionaires. The very wealthy should be paying more in taxes, not less."
"Can you believe this? We, as taxpayers, spent millions to develop a treatment for HIV. @GileadSciences disregarded our government patent to charge $2,000 a month for the very same drug. We have got to stop Big Pharma from price-gouging the American people."
"Imagine cancelling all student debt and making every public college tuition-free, so that the rich aren't vacationing off the backs of struggling students. .  . Now stop imagining. Let's tax Wall Street and do it."
"Per capita health care spending:. Norway: $6,647. United States: $11,072. . Number of uninsured/under-insured:. Norway: 0. United States: 92 million. . COVID-19 deaths: . Norway (population 5.3 million): 306. Louisiana (population 4.6 million): 6,260. . Yes. It is time for Medicare for All."
"As the voting rights bill finally comes to the floor of the Senate, there is only one vote which will really matter. Will 50 Democrats vote to override the filibuster, protect American democracy and pass the bill, or will Manchin and Sinema vote with the GOP and let the bill die?"
"We know what the goal of the far right is: overturn Roe v. Wade and outlaw all abortion in America. It is not a stretch to say that this would, quite literally, kill women. Here's how we fight back:"
"African-Americans are almost 4 times as likely to have force used on them by police—this is unacceptable. The time is long overdue for us to end ""stop and frisk"" practices, demilitarize our police departments, and reform our racist criminal justice system."
"Please don't tell me we can't afford to cancel student debt, make public colleges tuition-free or expand Social Security while billionaires like Donald Trump and corporations like Amazon pay nothing or next to nothing in taxes year after year."
"In an unprecedented way, we are witnessing a revitalization of American democracy with more and more people standing up and fighting back. #BernieResponds"
"We are the only major country where coronavirus infections and deaths are skyrocketing. That is beyond disgraceful.. . Providing all of our people with free, high-quality, reusable masks will help save tens of thousands of lives.. . We need #MasksforAll."
"This is what happens when employers raise wages from $7.25 an hour to $15 an hour: A job ""shortage"" turns into a surge in job applications. It ain't complicated. There's no labor shortage in America. There's a shortage of employers willing to pay a living wage with good benefits."
Trump backs Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen and sells them bombs they drop on children. Now he wants @Raytheon to help Saudis develop their own weapons. Congress must stop this president from doing the bidding of the arms industry and this brutal regime.
"The GOP leadership must decide whether Congress will continue being cowardly, obedient followers of the president's absurd policies. Despite battling brain cancer, Sen. John McCain has shown more courage in standing up to Trump than virtually the entire Republican Party combined."
"The consequences of the coronavirus on people already suffering from war are truly unimaginable.. . Humanity should end its conflicts and killing right now, and come together to save lives.. . The United States can and must play a leading role in bringing about a global ceasefire."
"An important thread about how even people with health insurance struggle to pay for health care. We must move to Medicare for all and guarantee health care as a right, not a privilege."
"We don't talk enough about the positive impact of Social Security. Before it was law, half of seniors lived in poverty. It cuts the racial wealth gap and has lifted millions from poverty. . . Our job is not to cut Social Security. Our job is to expand it."
"Nearly half of all college students are going hungry and the average college senior takes on $30,000 in debt..  . But let's go beyond statistics. Share your personal story in a video or tweet, with the hashtag #CollegeForAll. And tell me what we should be doing to fix this crisis."
"No government – not the federal government, not the state government and not the city government - should be handing out corporate welfare to union busters and labor law violators."
"While the majority of the American people have expressed overwhelming support for the Build Back Better Act and delivering for working Americans, Republicans continue to oppose it.. . Maybe, just maybe, that’s why they have to resort to voter suppression."
"There are more confirmed coronavirus cases in the White House than was the case today in Taiwan, New Zealand and Vietnam – countries with a combined population of 124 million. We cannot continue to have a president who rejects science and whose reckless behavior endangers lives."
The Koch brothers-funded Mercatus Center might not like that their report revealed Medicare for all will save Americans $2 trillion. But numbers don't lie.
"CBP and ICE are out of control. It’s time to hold these officials accountable for abuses, dismantle our cruel immigration system, and build a new one that is accountable, humane, and just."
"For the future of our country, the credibility of our commitments, and the well-being of our armed forces, Congress cannot continue to abdicate the constitutionally mandated war-making responsibilities which the founding fathers gave to them."
"Not only are the Koch brothers and other Republican billionaires trying to buy elections, Republican officials are actively working to suppress the vote. How cowardly is that! We need universal voter registration in this country."
"This year, Congress finally acted to give these first responders the financial security and medical attention they need as they cope with illnesses from the toxins they were exposed to at Ground Zero."
"The murder of Jamal Khashoggi is part of an alarming trend with Saudi Arabia. The United States must stand for human rights everywhere, and make clear to the Saudis that this includes their country too."
"At a time of massive wealth and income inequality and when half our people are living paycheck to paycheck, what this reconciliation bill will finally do is address the needs of our working families by asking the wealthy and large corporations to pay their fair share of taxes."
"There is virtually unanimous agreement in Congress that the murder of Jamal Khashoggi must be addressed. I look forward to supporting my colleagues’ additional legislative proposals at the appropriate time, but right now I am focused on securing an up or down vote on 54."
"It is truly sad and dangerous that only 7 Republicans voted to convict a president who is promoting a Big Lie, conspiracy theories and violence, and is aggressively trying to destroy American democracy."
.@SpeakerRyan: A bi-partisan majority of House members support strong legislation to protect Dreamers. Let them vote. Let democracy rule.
LIVE: The Senate Budget Committee is holding a hearing on the obscene concentration of ownership on Wall Street and the power that a handful of firms have over our entire economy.
"To all those celebrating, happy #LunarNewYear! Wishing good health, prosperity, and joy to you and your loved ones in the new year."
"I will be speaking on the Senate floor at 12:30 PM about the budget negotiations. I'm very disappointed that the Republican Party, which controls the White House, Senate and House, is pushing us closer and closer to a very dangerous government shutdown."
"It's unacceptable that childcare workers are paid less than 98% of all occupations while childcare is unaffordable for 60% of families who need it. We must make pre-school free, make sure no family pays over 7% of their income on childcare & pay childcare workers a living wage."
Listen to this former Wall Street banker explain how the big banks can crash our economy again if we don't break them up.
We are seeing record levels of hunger in the richest nation on earth. We cannot continue to prop up a grossly unjust economy in which the very rich get much richer while millions of working families struggle to afford the most basic necessities of life.
"LIVE: No, the microchip industry does not need a blank check of over $50 billion at a time when the companies are making billions of dollars in profits and paying their executives exorbitant compensation packages."
"When General Electric outsources jobs, it raves about China.. . When GE wants to pay $0 in taxes for eight straight years, or needs a $16 billion bailout, it doesn't talk about China.. . GE goes to the taxpayers of the United States for its welfare checks."
"The eyes of the world are watching the Senate today. Shortly, we will vote to end U.S. support for the disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen. Watch my speech here:"
"Sitting at his luxury golf club, Trump issued executive orders that:. . ❌ Won't stop evictions. ❌ Won't extend unemployment benefits. ❌ Won't support states and cities. . But I'm sure millions going jobless and hungry will be relieved to hear he had fun golfing."
"When Trump vetoed our historic legislation to end the horrors in Yemen, the peace movement in this country did not give up—they began mobilizing even more strongly.. . @RepRoKhanna is absolutely right. This is how we are going to stop this unconstitutional war."
"While we set aside this day to recognize our veterans, we must commit ourselves to keep America’s promise to them every day. #VeteransDay"
"It is outrageous that a drug discovered with American taxpayer dollars costs nearly $190,000. This is just one more example of the incredible greed of the pharmaceutical industry. I urge the Administration to use the tools they have to lower the cost of this drug now."
"I’ve been criticized for being an ""alarmist"" on climate change. That’s right. I am alarmed. Climate change is a global emergency and a major national security threat.. . We must bring the world together and take on the existential threat of climate change NOW. This can't wait."
"Republicans want to cut taxes for Trump's kids and other children of billionaire families. No. It's time to enact a progressive estate tax and start investing in programs that actually help working families, not the top 0.2%."
"Dr. King challenged all of us to fight against 3 major evils: “the evil of racism, the evil of poverty and the evil of war.”. . If there was ever a moment in history when we needed to fulfill Dr. King’s call for justice and demand a “radical revolution of values,"" now is that time."
Amazon paid $0 in taxes on $11 billion in annual profits. But it asks workers to “donate” their paid leave to others who are sick.. . Workers and taxpayers are expected to be generous. Corporate CEOs—even during a pandemic—can be as stingy as they want.
Republicans in Congress want the American people to believe that their tax scam was passed to benefit the middle class. But we know the truth: it was just a payoff to their donors.
I want to congratulate the House for holding hearings for the first time on Medicare for all. I’m confident the results will show that Medicare for all is the way forward if we want to guarantee heath care to all people in a cost-effective way.
Jane and I send our deepest condolences to the families of those whose lives were lost to the severe storms and tornadoes in Tennessee.. . The federal government must do everything it can to help rescue those missing or harmed and rebuild these communities.
"Let's be clear: the economic theory Trump has embraced, trickle-down economics, is an abysmal failure and a fraud."
"We must utilize the Defense Production Act to produce and deliver high-quality, N95 masks to every person in this country."
"In the past, Republicans used budget reconciliation to pass massive tax breaks for the rich and large corporations with a simple majority vote.. . As the incoming Chairman of the Budget Committee, I will fight to use the same process to boldly address the needs of working families."
It is unacceptable that African Americans are getting sick and dying from the coronavirus at such disproportionately high rates..  . We must solve the horrific racial disparities in health that we have in this country.
"$1,200 doesn't cut it. Congress must send a monthly $2,000 check to every person who needs it until this crisis is over."
"It is unbelievable that in the richest country on earth, community groups collect donations to pay off the lunch debt of elementary school kids.. . Here's a radical idea: every child in America has the right to eat free nutritious meals at school every day."
Do you want to know why you're being ripped off every day by drug companies? Maybe it's because there are two Big Pharma lobbyists for every member of Congress.
To all the Olympians representing Vermont at the 2022 Winter Olympics: Congratulations and good luck! .  . Representing our state and country in the Olympics is no small accomplishment and is a testament to the hard work and discipline of each of you.
"I stand with these Amazon employees who are courageously speaking out. They are telling Jeff Bezos to end his hypocrisy: You cannot call your corporation a ""leader"" on climate change while partnering with ExxonMobil and BP to extract more fossil fuels."
"However, I will be voting no. This bill does not address the great moral issue of our time – the fact that in three weeks 800,000 young Dreamers will lose their legal status and be subject to deportation."
Child care should not cost parents more than sending their kids to college. We need a revolution in child care in this country.
"If we don't get our act together, the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs will lead to the deaths of 1.1 million Medicare recipients over ten years. Unacceptable. The new Congress must have the guts to take on the pharmaceutical industry whose greed is killing Americans."
"Exactly 50 years after the moon landing, we can again mobilize as a nation to overcome enormous challenges. We have no time to waste in taking on climate change, which is a true national emergency. Here's how @repblumenauer and I plan to tackle it:"
While Disney’s CEO makes up to $423 million:. - 1 in 10 Disneyland workers have been homeless in the past 2 years. - More than 2 in 3 are food insecure. - 3 in 4 don’t make enough money to afford basic needs. . That is simply not acceptable. #CEOsvsWorkers
"In many ways, it is the most consequential piece of legislation for working families since the Great Depression."

"Year after year, the pharmaceutical industry makes extraordinary profits and provides their CEOs with obscenely high compensation packages."
I've got a challenge for Mr. Trump: Keep your damn promises.
"We have a president forcing hazardous meat plants to reopen, threatening workers' health.. . We have a Labor Department siding with corporations over workers' safety.. . Disgusting. Maybe this is too ""radical,"" but we need a White House that protects public health during a pandemic."

Let's be clear—any rescue of the airlines must put workers first. That means:. . ✔️Paying all workers at least $15 an hour. ✔️Ending stock buybacks. ✔️No outsourcing jobs. ✔️Expanding benefits. ✔️Workers sitting on corporate boards. . We cannot repeat the failures of the last bailout.
"When Trump tells people to ""listen to their doctors,"" we must not forget: 1 out of every 4 Americans do not have a primary care physician.. . In the midst of this crisis, we must provide everyone—regardless of income—with all of the health care they need without cost."
We need to understand the cost of Trump's move to withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal. Watch my foreign policy advisor break down this reckless decision:
"Pharma has spent hundreds of millions opposing our efforts to lower prescription drug costs. Meanwhile, the six major drug companies made $50 billion in profits last year and pay their CEOs outrageous salaries. We must stop Pharma greed and pass the Reconciliation Bill."
"I'm very disappointed in the vote today on prescription drugs by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. . . I get that the pharmaceutical industry owns the Republican Party and that no Republican voted for this bill, but there is no excuse for every Democrat not supporting it."
"No government – not the federal government, not the state government and not the city government – should be handing out corporate welfare to union busters and labor law violators."
"I could be wrong, but I don’t think Trump is going to be explaining tonight why he tried to throw 32 million people off of health insurance. #StateOfTheUnion"
Fox News can't believe their own poll says people want to tax the rich. The truth is: The overwhelming majority of the American people want the wealthy to pay their fair share.
"Article I of the Constitution clearly states that it is Congress, not the president, which has the power to declare war."
"Very proud of Vermont and other jurisdictions for leading the way. This is a critical victory for immigrants across the United States, who should never have to fear risking their status in order to access basic services."
"Storytellers are vital to our movement. @MarkRuffalo is lifting up the story of the ordinary heroes who stood up to the deadly lies and greed of DuPont.. . Corporations are used to buying off our political system. When millions of people come together, we are going to change that."
"It will also put the U.S. in a global leadership position to combat climate change and make our planet healthy and habitable for future generations, while creating millions of good paying jobs as we address the long-neglected needs of working families and saving the planet."

"For three decades, I have been advocating for tuition-free college. If you are new to this effort, we welcome you to the fight for justice."
"The U.S. has one of the highest rates of childhood poverty in the industrialized world. In the coming weeks, 39 million American families and 88 percent of children are going to get much needed relief in the form of monthly payments. It’s a good start, but we must do more."
"The U.S. has the world's largest economy. Yet, we lag far behind many other developed countries in health care, life expectancy, infant mortality, poverty, education and infrastructure. We need a government that works for all, not just the 1%."
"Hurricane Florence caused 350,000 gallons of toxic coal ash to spill into Carolina waterways. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is attempting to weaken EPA rules that protect our waterways."
"That will mean restructuring the agencies that enforce our immigration laws, including ICE. We must not be about tearing small children away from their families. We must not be about deporting DREAMers, young people who have lived in this country virtually their entire lives."
"In one of the wealthiest countries in the history of the world, no one should be in poverty. The current $7.25 an hour federal minimum wage is a starvation wage and must be increased to a living wage of $15 an hour. . . Time for the Senate to do its job and take a vote."
"For over 100 days since this pandemic began, frontline workers have been making unbelievable sacrifices every single day. From the bottom of our hearts, my staff and I say to all essential workers: Thank you."
"How many jobs are we talking about?.  . 📈 Nearly 250,000 good-paying, family-sustaining, union jobs per year across the country if this goes through.. . 🚙 At the same time, we reduce carbon pollution on the scale of taking 1.2 million cars off the road over 10 years."
Republicans are laughing all the way to Election Day. They have not had to cast one vote against any enormously popular policies. That’s got to change now.
"Call me crazy, but I believe the richest country in the world has no business sacrificing the health of our essential workers. We need vigorous workplace safety enforcement, paid sick leave, free health care, and monthly $2,000 payments during this"
Extremist Republican legislators lost again today. Abortion is a constitutional right and we will make damn sure it stays that way.
Millions of our people are working for starvation wages. Here is the simple truth. Nobody can raise a family or pay the rent on poverty wages of $8 or $9 an hour.. . We are the wealthiest country in the world. We can do better. We can raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
The cruelty of this White House knows no bounds. Foreign students are being threatened with a choice: risk your life going to class in-person or get deported.. . We must stand up to Trump's bigotry. We must keep all our students safe.

"Trump downplayed the threat of coronavirus for political gain. He told the American people this deadly virus would disappear.. . As a result of his lies and rejection of science, 200,000 people in this country have died."
Unprecedented times require unprecedented action. I’m LIVE on the Senate floor NOW as we start debate on the most consequential legislation for the working class since the New Deal.
It is unconstitutional for the United States to continue its involvement in the war in Yemen without Congressional approval.
All Americans should have face masks that will keep them safe. I will be introducing legislation tomorrow for N95 masks to be sent to every household in the country. This will save lives and reduce health care costs.
The Trump tax cuts are rewarding Wells Fargo—the bank that defrauded millions of customers last year—with $3.7 billion. How does that make sense?
It was a Republican president — not Bernie Sanders — who first argued for the creation of a progressive estate tax to reduce the enormous concentration of wealth. Mitch McConnell might want to listen.
We are saying that all public colleges and universities should be tuition-free and debt-free for ALL Americans. . . All Americans are entitled to Social Security.. All Americans are entitled to health care.. All Americans are entitled to education as a right.
"As we enter the new year let us not forget that while the very rich become much richer, millions of Americans are unable to afford health care, housing, prescription drugs or education. In 2019 we can do better. We must do better."
Ted Cruz keeps saying we have the highest corporate tax rate in the world. That is false. #TaxDebate
The GOP tax bill must be defeated. We should then sit down and develop tax policy that actually works for working families. #TaxDebate
"Life expectancy is in direct correlation to income. If you are poor in this country, you can expect to live 15 years LESS than if you are rich. To my mind, that is ABSURD..  . We must build a health care system and economy that work for all of us, not just a few."
"250,000 are dead from coronavirus. 12 million will lose unemployment benefits by the end of the year.. . Where's Trump?. . He's busy golfing and sending out bogus tweets, trying overturn the results of a democratic election he lost by more than 6 million votes. Pathetic."
"The jury's verdict delivers accountability for Derek Chauvin, but not justice for George Floyd. Real justice for him and too many others can only happen when we build a nation that fundamentally respects the human dignity of every person."
"On Veterans Day, let us renew our promise to returned service members by ending the injustices that too many of them face, such as homelessness, loneliness, and deportations. We must also strengthen the VA so that veterans and their families get the support they deserve."
Watch @docdanielle debunk one of Fox News' most pathetic single payer myths:
"Our political task is not just to improve life for working families in terms of decent income, health care, education, etc. It is to change the political paradigm so that people demand their full rights as human beings, and not just scraps from the table."
"$3.7 billion in a single day. That's how much 3 members of the Walton family saw their wealth increase. At a time of massive wealth and income inequality, when so many of our people are hurting, that is morally obscene.. . It's time to tax billionaires and expand Medicare to all."
Let's be clear: Trickle-down economics is nothing but a fraudulent theory designed by the rich and their think tanks to protect billionaires and large corporations.
"When people stand up and say, ""I am a human being. This is what I deserve”—that is the beginning of a political revolution."
"Let's be clear. If 10 Republican Senators cannot even vote for a bipartisan commission to investigate the January 6th insurrection, 10 Republican Senators will not vote for anything meaningful to improve the lives of the American people. We must abolish the filibuster & act now."
"I proudly stand in solidarity with every single worker who is right now fighting to build an economy based on human needs, not corporate greed."
"100,000 Americans die every year from air pollution.. . 100 super-polluters spew one-third of America's toxic emissions, harming poor communities the most..  . Corporate polluters must be required to foot the bill to clean up our air and save American lives."
"Even the part of Trump’s tax scam supposedly for low-income neighborhoods is a massive tax avoidance scheme for the ultra-rich..  . President Trump has many critics. But as a con artist, he is a talent of the highest caliber."
"I had the honor of serving with Carl in the Senate for a number of years. He was a man of intelligence, decency and commitment. Jane and I send our condolences to the Levin family."
"States are working to get this virus under control despite the Trump administration's incompetence.. . The federal government must step in to provide everyone in America three high-quality, reusable masks free of charge.. . Masks for All can help states get this virus under control."
"The Saudi-led intervention in Yemen has resulted in the worst humanitarian crisis on Earth. That crisis is 85,000 children starving to death; 10,000 new cases of cholera every single week; and the United Nations telling us that Yemen is on the verge of imminent famine."
"Our job: pursue a bold agenda that transforms our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. . . We're at war with climate change and, for the sake of our kids and grandchildren, we cannot lose."
"Half of our seniors survive on $25,000 a year or less.. . Outrageously, Trump tried to make them jump through hoops during a pandemic to get their $1,200 emergency relief payment.. . Thanks to strong pressure, Trump reversed this policy. Seniors will get the help they need right now."
"At a moment when U.S.-made bombs are devastating Gaza, and killing women and children, we cannot simply let another huge arms sale go through without even a Congressional debate."
"Trump's still trying to waste billions of taxpayer dollars on a wall, using a phony ""national emergency"" to ignore Congress and the Constitution..  . Think of the urgent work we could be doing together, instead, if we treated climate change like the national emergency that it is."
"Under this budget, however, no family making under $400,000 a year will pay a penny more in taxes and will, in fact, receive one of the largest tax cuts in American history."
"On Earth Day, let us recommit to coming together and taking on the existential threat of climate change. We must act now to save the planet."
I am so grateful to America's nurses. Nurses are the backbone of our health care system and it is no wonder Americans trust them more than any other profession. They deserve tremendous respect and support from all of us.
"It’s time for Medicare to finally cover hearing, dental and vision care."
"The president can boast about the stock market all he wants—the American people know it doesn't put food on the table. We need an economy that works for the many, not just the wealthy and large corporations."
What world is Trump living in? Does he not understand what's going on? Is he being blackmailed because the Russians have compromising information on him? Or is he sympathetic to Putin's style of authoritarianism? . . Congress must step in and stop Russian meddling in our elections.
"Strong unions are the reason why America once led the world in wages in benefits. No wonder they're so popular, despite decades of right-wing attacks. We must rebuild the trade union movement in this country."
"Today, with seven of my Senate colleagues, I sent a letter to Kaiser Permanente Chair and CEO Greg Adams in support of the more than 30,000 nurses and health care workers planning to strike unless negotiations for a fair contract improve."
"The Social Security Administration confirmed what we already knew. Trump's disastrous plan to defund Social Security would eliminate retirement and disability benefits by 2023. That may make sense to the billionaires at Trump's country club, but it makes zero sense to me."
I stand in solidarity with the courageous Amazon workers engaging in a work stoppage against unconscionable working conditions in their warehouses. It is not too much to ask that a company owned by the wealthiest person in the world treat its workers with dignity and respect.
"A society which proclaims freedom as its goal, as the United States does, must work unceasingly to end the disgraceful bigotry and violence against transgender Americans."
I stand with Jetblue inflight crew members as they vote on joining @transportworker. All workers should have a union fighting for their rights at work.
"Think of the alternative to these power outages and intense wildfires if America tackles climate change. . . We can build a smart, safe, and modern electrical grid that gives every American access to clean, cheap, and reliable energy from renewables."
"If your plan to get elected is to suppress as many minority voters, young voters, and voters with disabilities as possible, it's pretty clear you shouldn't be in politics in the first place."
A 1.5-million-acre “megafire” is threatening Australia.. . Indonesia is dealing with deadly floods.. . We cannot keep avoiding the fact that climate change is our existential challenge as a global community.. . Let’s get on with the work of saving our planet.
"My simple question is, why in the world would the United States reward a regime that has caused such pain in Yemen with more weapons. The answer is we should not."
"Tomorrow, the Senate is going to be casting an enormously important vote about whether we preserve the foundations of democracy. As of now, two Democrats will join the Republicans to vote against us and we will lose that vote. Let me tell you why I hope they change their minds."
"Disability rights are civil rights.. . As we commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act today, we must fight to ensure that every person with a disability has the right to live in their community and has the support they need to thrive."
"While Donald Trump says he wants ""the world's cleanest and safest air,"" he is fighting so that polluters can spew out more mercury and soot that will kill Americans..  . Ordinary people are paying the price for Trump's lies."
Joining us now: Mayor Dale Ross of @georgetowntx—a Republican who transitioned his city's municipal electric utility to 100% renewable energy sources. #ClimateTownHall
5pm ET TONIGHT: Tune in here for a livestream Q&A discussion with me and White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator @AshishKJha46. We’ll be answering your questions on what’s happening with the pandemic and the best ways to stay safe and healthy.
"Minimum wage in 1968 (in today's dollars): $11.84. . Federal minimum wage in 2021: $7.25. . Please do not tell me that in the richest country on Earth, we cannot guarantee a living wage of at least $15 an hour to every worker in America."
"This is what Oligarchy and corporate greed are all about. Two large and profitable corporations, owned by billionaires, spend millions to illegally deny their workers the right to organize. No corporation that breaks the law should get a federal contract."
My thoughts are with my colleagues and all those injured and killed in the train crash this morning.
This is what the undermining of American democracy looks like. This is what is taking place all across the country. This is why it is an outrage that two Democratic senators have joined Republicans in refusing to pass the Freedom to Vote bill.
"The Trump administration must reverse this decision. We cannot make cuts to essential and life-saving programs to pay for their racist, xenophobic agenda."
"This week we have seen more and more evidence of President Trump’s dangerous disregard for the democratic norms of our country, and stunning revelations about his erratic and misguided policy decisions and his pathological lying. We live in dangerous and unprecedented times."
"Mr. President: Respect the Constitution. You have no legal authority to launch an attack on Iran. Come to Congress, present your evidence, and make your case. If not, we will assert our power under the War Powers Act to stop you."
The Saudi-led war in Yemen has become the world's largest humanitarian disaster. The recent disappearance and likely assassination of Jamal Khashoggi only underscores how urgent it has become for the United States to redefine our relationship with Saudi Arabia.
"Mr. Romney supports ""bribes"" in the form of tax cuts for the wealthy and billions in welfare for corporations, but is shocked by the idea that working Americans might get help paying off student debt. I know he thinks corporations are people, but does he know people are people?"
"Mr. Trump lied. He promised to strengthen health care—instead, he has done everything he can to sabotage the Affordable Care Act.. . The result: Nearly two million people joined the ranks of the uninsured last year, the first increase in the uninsured rate in a decade."
"Incredibly, Republican leaders in the Senate have introduced a bill to repeal the estate tax for the richest 1,700 families in America. That's absurd.. . From a moral, economic and political perspective our nation will not thrive when so few have so much and so many have so little."
"The struggle at the VA is about Trump's desire to privatize the VA and his belief that Shulkin is not moving fast enough in that direction. The Senate Veterans Committee, on which I serve, must stand with the veterans of our country and oppose all efforts to privatize the VA."
Starting soon: Facebook Live conversation on the state of politics and digital media. Watch at
It's time to debate with Bernie. Tune in now. #CNNDebateNight
"Women must have full control over their reproductive health. They must have equal pay for equal work: the whole damn dollar, not 79 cents on the dollar.. . We will not go backward. We will go forward. Let us celebrate #InternationalWomensDay with a pledge to defend women's rights."
"After a SeaWorld trainer was drowned by a killer whale in 2010, Judge Kavanaugh said the company should be immune from penalty."
"As a nation, we need to get our priorities right. I wanted to take a minute to tell you why I’m voting against the defense spending bill."
The obscene level of income and wealth inequality in America is a profoundly moral issue that we cannot continue to ignore or sweep under the rug. A society cannot sustain itself when so few have so much while so many have so little.
"Here is what we need to do: Convene the countries of this hemisphere to address the violence and deprivation that is prompting people to flee their own countries. As neighbors, we can solve these problems together."
Let's remember why NFL players started kneeling. They are talking about the need for criminal justice reform and police department reform.
President Trump: you are not improving health care when you deny funding to Planned Parenthood and deny millions of women their provider of health care. Stop the attack on women's health.
"The idea that political donors in America expect a specific policy result in exchange for their contributions—a quid pro quo, the definition of corruption—is no longer even seen as scandalous. This sort of corruption is common among authoritarian regimes. #SandersSAIS"
"Join me, @repmarkpocan, our colleagues and union leaders as we introduce the Workplace Democracy Act, which would strengthen the middle class by restoring workers' rights to bargain for better wages, benefits and working conditions."
Do you live in a country with universal health care? What does that mean for you and your family? #MedicareForAll
Trump lied 19 times about Medicare for all in half an op-ed. How is that even possible?
Our health system isn't designed to provide quality care to all in a cost-effective way. It's designed to provide huge profits to insurance and drug companies and exorbitant compensation packages to CEOs.
Trump’s decision to cut funding to the World Health Organization—in the middle of a pandemic—endangers American lives. And his own officials know it.. . This is a global crisis. We have got to strongly support multilateral institutions like the WHO to confront it.
"Last night, Trump was in Montana, telling people that Democrats want to ""destroy your Social Security"" and are ""going to ruin your Medicare."". . Really? That's funny..."
"If 700 U.S. billionaires could become nearly $2 trillion richer during the pandemic and Trump could provide over $1 trillion in tax breaks to the top 1% and profitable corporations, please don't tell me we can't cancel all $1.8 trillion in student debt for 45 million Americans."
"250 pages.. . 37,500 words.. . Not a single damn mention of “climate change.”. . Trump’s NAFTA is a giveaway to the fossil fuel industry.. . I voted NO because the future of our planet is more important than the short-term profits of Exxon Mobil and Chevron."
Climate change is more likely to impact poor people and people of color first and worst. Yet the world's poorest people are least responsible for the changing climate.. . We must transition our economy away from fossil fuels to fight growing inequality here and around the world.
"LIVE: The Senate Budget Committee is holding a hearing focused on waste, fraud and cost overruns at the Pentagon."
President Trump forced hazardous meat plants to reopen to protect the profits of large corporations over the lives of meatpacking workers who got sick and died from coronavirus.. . Beyond disgusting. It's time to put people before profits.
Toronto physician Dr. Danyaal Raza explains that having a single payer system does not mean having a lower quality system. Canada has longer life expectancy than in the U.S. and better health outcomes. #MedicareForAll
".@keithellison breaks down why Trump's tax plan means more yachts, homes and political influence for the wealthiest people in this country."
"If Canada and every other major country on earth can guarantee paid leave, so can the United States. We must end this international embarrassment. (With @MadeleineSix)"
Tonight Donald Trump is going to be giving his #StateOfTheUnion address. I hope you'll join me at 10:45 PM EST for my response at
Why do we spend more on the military than the next 11 nations combined? Why do millions live in poverty in the richest country in the world?. . It's time to change our national priorities. @SenSchumer and I are fighting to cut Pentagon spending by 10% and invest it in human needs.
"I stand in solidarity with Amazon warehouse workers demanding to be treated like human beings. They are sick and tired of the brutal working conditions, injuries, surveillance, and workplace deaths—all to fatten the pockets of a billion-dollar corporation."
"As we face the rapidly spreading omicron variant, we should remember that not all face masks are created equal. Congress must demand the mass production and distribution of N-95 masks, the most effective way to stop the spread of the Covid virus."
"Tomorrow, we start our push to make public colleges and universities tuition free. Tune in at 7 PM ET:"
"5pm ET THURSDAY: Join me and White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator @AshishKJha46 for a livestream Q&A discussion. We will discuss what’s going on now with the pandemic, what the future may hold, and the best ways to stay safe and healthy."
"What would be truly heroic is if Disney used its profits from Avengers to pay all of its workers a middle class wage, instead of paying its CEO Bob Iger $65.6 million – over 1,400 times as much as the average worker at Disney makes."
Listen to this Fox News pundit condemn the tear gassing of women and children.
"LIVE: Join me and U.S. Fire Administrator Dr. Lori Moore-Merrell as we hear from Vermont firefighters and EMS providers about the challenges they face and how the federal, state, and local government can support their service to our communities."
"We should pay attention to this: Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right authoritarian, is rapidly destroying the Amazon rainforest. He is a threat to working people, minorities, journalists, and a habitable planet. No wonder Trump loves him so much."
"Think about it for a minute.. . Democrats and Republicans come together, after a whole lot of debate, and agree on how to keep the government open.. . And then, after a day of right-wing media criticism, the president undermines all of that. To say the least, that is problematic."
"At a time when one out of four Americans cannot afford their prescription drugs, maybe, just maybe, it’s time we take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry."
It's time to reduce the heavy burden of student debt that is weighing down the lives of millions of former college students and make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
Congress made history this week by passing my resolution with @SenMikeLee to cut off U.S. support for Saudi-led forces in the civil war in Yemen.
"This is what a rigged economy looks like: Working 100 hours in a week, not getting paid and actually owing the company a check.. . Port truck drivers in this country deserve justice!"
"While a record number of Americans are unemployed, the very rich continue to get richer. In 5 months, the wealth of 3 billionaires increased by:. . ⬆️$81.9 billion: Jeff Bezos. ⬆️$60.6 billion: Elon Musk. ⬆️$41.8 billion: Mark Zuckerberg. . #MakeBillionairesPay"
"This is what an energy transition looks like when we have no plan. The coal company Blackjewel has filed for bankruptcy—meanwhile, its miners have not been paid for weeks. . . We need to move to a sustainable economy with a just and fair transition for workers and their families."
"""I don't look at a recession as a bad thing."" - Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan Chase (one of the big banks that crashed the economy 10 years ago)."
"To have a president of the United States who says such outrageous nonsense, it is really sad."
"Student debt cancellation will be fully paid for by a tax on Wall Street speculation—similar to what exists in dozens of other countries. . . The American people bailed out Wall Street, now it's Wall Street's turn to help America's working families."
The science is clear: toxic PFAS “forever chemicals” are a danger to our health. Congress must pass my PFAS Act to:. . ✓ Hold corporate polluters like DuPont accountable. ✓ Fund drinking water cleanup. ✓ Ban PFAS in food packaging. ✓ Stop PFAS air pollution
"I wrote about the courageous Yemeni human rights defender @RAlmutawakel, who is documenting the terrible human cost of U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's war, for @TIME's #TIME100 issue."
"At a time when some billionaires pay nothing – not a nickel – in a given year in taxes, yes, it is time for the rich to pay their fair share."
What a disgrace that it takes a 16-year-old to tell world leaders what they won't acknowledge: We cannot continue with this type of ruthless capitalism that is destroying our planet. This is why we need young people leading our climate justice movement.
"What if instead of helping billionaires fund their space hobby, we invested in working people here on Earth?"
It will take on the existential threat of climate change by creating millions of good-paying jobs transforming our energy systems away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy.
"Never forget. While Trump came within 1 vote in the Senate from taking away health insurance from 32 million Americans, his administration had no problem handing out billions in corporate welfare to the pharmaceutical industry – the most profitable industry in America."
Why do Americans pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs? Could it have anything to do with the fact that last year 9 large pharmaceutical companies made over $58 billion in profits?
"No senior should have to sell their belongings or spend their life savings just to be able to age in place. . . Under the Medicare for All, long-term, home-based care will be guaranteed as a right to every senior and person with a disability in America."
"While the GOP prevented adequate financial relief to working families, they did get:. . -$120 billion tax break for business owners in the 1%. -$6.3 billion tax break for a 3-martini lunch. -$4.2 billion tax break for offshore tax scams. -$2 billion for the space force. . Pathetic."
"Will the Republicans in Congress listen to the American people, or simply obey the dictates of the NRA?"
"Russia’s attack on our democracy is of enormous consequence. Trump must not, in any way, try to derail or obstruct Mueller's investigation."
I couldn’t resist a chance to ask that CNN talk about the real issues affecting the American people.
"According to a new Gallup poll, 112 million (44%) Americans are struggling to pay for healthcare, and more than double that number (93%) feel that what they do pay is not worth the cost. Yes. It's time for a health care new system. It's time for Medicare for All."
"Trump doesn't believe that universal health care works anywhere in the world. He should listen to what he said about Canada, Scotland and Australia. Every other major country on earth does it. Stop lying Mr. President."
Are you truly free if you work 100 hours a week because you can’t find a job with a living wage? Are you free if you have no health care?
"Trump's plan for the coronavirus so far:. . -Cut winter heating assistance for the poor. -Have VP Pence, who wanted to ""pray away"" HIV epidemic, oversee the response. -Let ex-pharma lobbyist Alex Azar refuse to guarantee affordable vaccines to all. . Disgusting."
Money laundering. Bribery. Mortgage fraud. Collusion. Currency manipulation. Rate tampering.. . These are just some of the routine business practices on Wall Street.. . The business model of Wall Street is fraud. It is not the exception to the rule—it is the rule. Break them up.
"Not long ago, people said a $15 minimum wage was unthinkable. But a grassroots movement refused to take no for an answer.. . Today, the President's order begins raising the minimum wage to $15/hour for federal contractors.. . Now, Congress must pass a $15 living wage for ALL workers."
The fact that Jeff Bezos became the world's first $200 billion man at a time of unprecedented human pain and suffering is morally grotesque.. . No. Billionaires should not be allowed to make $800 billion during a pandemic.. . Our job: Tax the rich and expand Medicare to all.
False. The effective tax rate for large profitable corporations is just 14%. Corporate taxes as a share of GDP are lower than 22 countries.
I’m LIVE now at the Progressive Strategy Summit to discuss the path forward for an agenda that finally meets the needs of the working class.
I agree with the joint statement from the Virginia House and Senate Democrats. Very serious and credible allegations have been made by two women against Lieutenant Governor Fairfax. He needs to resign.
"Remember when Trump said Big Pharma was ""getting away with murder""? Well Mr. President, you don't take on pharma by giving them massive tax breaks."
"Look at what is happening in the Pacific Northwest right now. If we do not significantly invest in transforming our energy system, future generations will never forgive us."
Corporate America's refusal to provide paid sick leave to workers is not only inhumane—it is deadly.. . Congress must guarantee paid medical leave to every worker in America as a right.
"Find out the answer LIVE tomorrow at 10 a.m. during our Senate hearing on the cost of prescription drugs. You can watch on Twitter, Facebook, or YouTube."
"In the richest country in the history of the world, 1 in 4 Americans are unable to afford their prescription drugs. That is ABSURD."
"In the fight against climate change, we have a choice: protect the profits of the fossil fuel industry or protect the future of our children."
"The four largest banks in America—Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo—are on average 80 percent larger than they were before they were bailed out by American taxpayers.. . Our job is to break them up."
Our health care system is wasteful. It’s expensive. And it has worse outcomes than most other major countries. Watch the Medicare for All Town Hall tonight to learn how we can do better.
"Members of Congress cannot go back to our families for the holidays when children in the richest country on Earth are going hungry and millions are scared to death of eviction.. . We must pass my amendment with @HawleyMO to get $1,200 direct checks to the working class of America."
"President Trump, you want to talk about a crisis? 7 million Americans have become uninsured since you took office. The uninsured rate is the highest in 5 years.. . We must end the embarrassment of being the only major country not to guarantee health care for all. #MedicareForAll"
These guys in the pharmaceutical industry in my humble opinion are crooks.
"Poll after poll shows overwhelming support for the Build Back Better legislation. The American people are saying loudly and clearly: We want government to work for us, not the billionaires."
"Congress presented Trump with our bipartisan bill to end the illegal U.S.-Saudi war in Yemen.. . He vetoed it..  . Violence has gotten worse, hundreds of thousands are dead, and Trump coddles the brutal Saudi dictatorship.. . It's time to end this damn war."
"If we stay on our current track, children today will have a lower standard of living than their parents. It is the American dream in reverse.. . Is it such a ""radical"" idea to say that every American has the right to a quality education, a living wage and health care?"
President Trump is dead wrong if he believes the solution to the Postal Service's problems is to privatize it. I stand with the Postal Workers fighting to save and strengthen the Postal Service.
"I am so proud of the youth fighting against climate change. I thank them for their relentless work in the fight for a cleaner, safer world."
These workers have been on the frontlines in our fight against COVID-19. They risked their lives to save patients – showing up to work despite not being provided basic protective equipment.
We must stand with Dreamers to stop Donald Trump from throwing them out of the only country they have ever known.
Today marks 100 days since Congress let the Children’s Health Insurance Program expire. . . Let me say that again: health care for 9 million children has hung in the balance for 100 days. . . We must do better than this.
"At a time of unprecedented greed, the Senate is right now debating giving $53 billion to the highly profitable micro-chip industry and a $10 billion bailout to Jeff Bezos so that he can launch a rocket ship to the moon. I'm LIVE on the floor to oppose it."
"I voted against the Patriot Act in 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2015. I strongly oppose its reauthorization next month.. . I believe that in a democratic and constitutional form of government, we cannot sacrifice the civil liberties that make us a free country."
"The days of billionaires running Washington is going to end. We are finally going to make sure government stands up for ordinary Americans, not the wealthy and powerful."
"He promised to pass tax reform that would benefit the middle class, but is now supporting legislation that gives 62% of the benefits to the top 1% and would, after 10 years, raise taxes on 83 million middle-class families."
"The grotesque level of wealth inequality, from a moral, economic and political perspective, is the great challenge we face. We cannot have a vibrant democracy or a just economy when so few have so much, and so many have so little."
Tonight Trump—who in less than two years in the White House has seen 5 aides either plead guilty or be convicted of criminal charges—claimed the strength of the economy was dependent on him being free from necessary oversight and investigations. The exact opposite is true. #SOTU
"This is what the political revolution is all about: today 350,000 Amazon workers found out they are getting a raise to at least $15 an hour."
"""I am alive today not because of insurance companies but despite them."".  . We are the only major country that allows private insurance companies to rip us off, rob us of our health, and drive our people into financial or emotional catastrophe."
"The future for our country and planet is in renewable energy, not fossil fuel. #ProtectTheArctic"
"Betsy DeVos has a brilliant idea. While paltry school budgets deny kids a decent education, she may let states use federal funds to buy guns for educators—not books, computers or pay raises. Guns. Meanwhile the Trump administration opposes all commonsense gun safety legislation."
Jeff Bezos is the wealthiest person in the world. It is not enough for him to offer 25 cents-an-hour wage increases to employees making grossly inadequate wages.. . There is no reason why Bezos and Amazon cannot pay workers $15 an hour plus decent benefits.
President Biden is right. The time is now to waive IP protections to enable vaccine technologies to be shared as widely as possible.
"I voted against the war in Iraq. Sadly, much of what I feared in fact did happen. I don't want to see it happen again."
"Decades of corporate trade have devastated our manufacturing base, killing millions of blue-collar jobs.. . A Green New Deal ends that. We will create millions of good, union jobs to manufacture renewable energy, increase energy efficiency, and rebuild our infrastructure."
"On days like this we are reminded of the sacrifices made by all those women and men who have worn the uniform in defense of our nation. We owe our veterans a tremendous debt of gratitude, which we will never truly be able to repay."
How do the drug companies get away with charging Americans the highest prices for prescription drugs on Earth? Maybe it's because there are two Big Pharma lobbyists for every member of Congress.
The billionaire class has seen its wealth explode during the pandemic while half of our people continue to live paycheck to paycheck.
"But let me be clear. The American Rescue Plan was emergency legislation. We must now either make the expansion permanent or, at least, extend it for a number of years. And that’s exactly what I’m fighting to do now."
"The American people want a government, an economy, an environment that works for all of us, not just the few. #FossilFree"
"The 2008 Wall Street bailout was never meant to help ordinary people. It only emboldened Wall Street’s greed, recklessness and fraud. Bonuses went up, no one went to jail. That’s why I voted against it. It’s time to break up the big banks once and for all."
Nearly half our college students are going hungry. The top 25 hedge-fund managers on average get $850 million a year—each.. . Wall Street’s greed wrecked the hopes and futures of an entire generation. So we will tax Wall Street to cancel all student debt and offer college for all.
Trump’s proposed increase in base Pentagon spending could make public colleges and universities tuition-free over the next decade.
No. Defeating the Big Oil side deal is not about revenge. It's about whether we will stand with 650 environmental and civil rights organizations who understand that the future of the planet is with renewable energy and energy efficiency not approving the Mountain Valley Pipeline.
"Across America, our schools are facing a financial meltdown and millions of kids struggle with hunger.. . Meanwhile, billionaire Betsy DeVos is making $56-100 million a year.. . She will go down in history as the worst, most out-of-touch Education Secretary to ever hold that office."
"I must confess that I love diners. I have not eaten at every diner in Vermont, but I've been to most. They're unpretentious, the food is good, the prices are right and the staff are friendly. Join us on a visit to the Blue Benn in Bennington."
LIVE TOWN HALL: Has Trump put America on the path to war by pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal? Join our town hall now as we discuss that question and more with a panel of experts. #BernieTownHall
Let us not forget: Climate change is the existential crisis of our time. This is the moment for bold action to empower the frontline communities who are most affected as we transform our energy system. This is how we prevent irreparable harm to our planet.
"Next month, I plan to give the Senate another chance to vote on my resolution to end our support for the war in Yemen, to reassert Congressional authority over matters of war, and to show the Saudis that they do not have a blank check to continue human rights violations."
"Mitch McConnell said that 100% of his focus is to oppose President Biden. Not 50%, not 80%, but 100%. If we're going to achieve anything meaningful for working families we must use reconciliation, abolish the filibuster and pass legislation with 51 votes. We can't afford to wait."
"Interesting. Trump and Putin are not only billionaire, anti-democratic authoritarians but they deny the crisis of climate change and push fossil fuels. What's the connection?"
"At a time of massive and growing income & wealth inequality and as the top 1% has more wealth than the bottom 92%, now is the time to demand that the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share so that we can begin to address the long neglected needs of working families."
"In our system of government, Congress alone controls government spending. And we did not give Trump the money to waste on his damn wall. . . I say this with no great pleasure, but we have a President of the United States who has not read, or does not understand, the Constitution."
"The United States Congress just passed a $738 billion giveaway for arms manufacturers, Pentagon lobbyists, and unconstitutional wars. . . @RepRoKhanna is right—this is not what resistance to Donald Trump looks like."
I’ll be live on the floor of the U.S. Senate at 3 p.m. ET TODAY to discuss our collapsing health care system and why we need Medicare for All.
"During the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans think they can take a long vacation while millions of Americans face hunger and eviction. That is morally obscene. It's time for the do-nothing Republican Senate to finally do its damn job."
"If we are serious about transforming our country, rebuilding the middle class and reinvigorating our democracy: let us bring our people together to take on and defeat a ruling class whose greed is destroying our nation. #SOTU"
"I listened to Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh. I believe Dr. Ford. . . Brett Kavanaugh does not belong on the Supreme Court.. . If Judge Kavanaugh wants to clear his name of these serious charges he should demand an FBI investigation. If not, the Senate must reject his nomination."
I don’t understand how a president of the United States give a State of the Union speech and not mention climate change. #BernieResponds
"In America, a woman—not the government or her employer—must control her own body. We must vigorously defend women’s access to all reproductive health services and allow them to make their own medical decisions."
This is the latest disgraceful attack on women’s rights by the Trump administration. Title X funds provide much-needed family planning services for millions of people around this country.
"While the owner of Tyson Foods became $600 million richer during the pandemic, 11,000 of his workers got COVID-19 because they were forced back to work in unsafe and unhealthy plants as managers placed bets on how many would get sick. We must end this disgusting corporate greed."
"The President has left the House of Representatives no choice but to begin an impeachment inquiry. I believe impeachable offenses were committed, and the House will now lay out the case. No president is above the law, and it is our responsibility to safeguard the Constitution."
"Congratulations to all those in House of Representatives who voted on the right side of history today. All people, regardless of who they are or who they love, deserve fair and equal treatment. #EqualityAct"
"I think the American people are united on this: We need policies now which benefit the working families of this country, that benefit low-income people, that benefit the most vulnerable."
Cost of a standard unit of insulin:. . United States: $98.70. Japan: $14.40. Canada: $12.00. Germany: $11.00. France: $9.08. United Kingdom: $7.52. . Here's what the price of a standard unit of insulin would cost if my Prescription Drug Price Relief Act passed: $10.80. Let's get it done.

"How do we pay for quality health care, guaranteed to all our people? Pretty simple, in my view. The way every other rich country does. #MedicareForAll"
"You can't get 80 percent of the American people to agree on what type of ice cream is best, and yet you have an even larger majority now who agree on giving Dreamers protection and a path towards citizenship."

"Our job is not only to provide every American with health care, but substantially expand Medicare benefits. Medicare for All will:. . 👩🏽‍⚕️ Cover vision, hearing, and dental care for all. 💊 Cap everyone's out-of-pocket drug costs at $200 a year. 🏠 Support long-term care at home"
Every child deserves a quality education free of hunger.
Now is the time for Congress to once again come together and make certain that the president will not have one penny to spend on a war in Iran unless there is Congressional authorization. #NoWarWithIran
"When we raise the minimum wage to a living wage, poverty will go down and new jobs will be created. This a win-win for the economy and our country. It's time to pass a $15 minimum wage."
"The great economic crisis of our time is that millions of American workers earn starvation wages. Large, profitable corporations owned by multi-billionaires should provide their employees with a living wage and decent working conditions."
"If you're experiencing mail delays, you're not alone. It’s time to strengthen the Postal Service, not dismantle it. It’s time to stand up for the dedicated postal workers clocking 12-hour shifts, seven days a week for their communities."
"I find it very strange that President Trump has such a hard time getting along with the leaders of the world's major democracies, but feels very comfortable with despots and authoritarian leaders."
Taxpayer dollars should not go to companies like Amazon and multi-billionaires like Jeff Bezos who repeatedly break the law to defeat union organizing efforts. I'm LIVE on the floor of the Senate to say to President Biden it is time for action.
"Last year, CEOs of the top 350 firms in the U.S. made, on average, 351 times more than a typical worker. . . To my mind, that is absurd. It is time to end the obscene levels of income inequality in this country."
"If our farmworkers fall ill, we go hungry. Our health and wellbeing are all interconnected.. . We must put an end to their cramped, impoverished conditions, and provide free health care, paid sick leave, and good wages—regardless of immigration status."
"Today, nearly one out of every four Americans cannot afford the medications that their doctors prescribe.. . Enough is enough. It is time to end the corporate greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower the cost of prescription drugs."
"Income and wealth inequality is soaring. Today, 1 in 4 U.S. workers are either unemployed or earn a poverty wage of less than $20,000 a year. Meanwhile, the 50 richest Americans own more wealth than the bottom 50%. We have got to create an economy that works for all, not the 1%."
"Given the horrific extent of this crisis, it would be unacceptable to take a major step backwards and pass legislation that only included $348 billion in new money.. . My colleagues and I are demanding real relief for the American people."
"Just as we were led into Vietnam and Iraq by lies, Donald Trump is misleading us on Iran. I will do everything that I can as a United States Senator to prevent such a war."
"Tomorrow, the Budget Committee, which I Chair, will be taking a hard look at waste, fraud and cost overruns at the Pentagon. Despite receiving $740 billion, the Pentagon remains the only agency in the federal government that cannot pass an independent audit. Not acceptable."
"The corporate media and corporate-funded politicians do not talk about it often, but we now face grotesque income and wealth inequality. No. It is not acceptable for two billionaires to own more wealth than the bottom 40%, or the top 1% to own more than the bottom 92%."
"Now is the time to rally the American people around an agenda that works for all, not just the 1%."
This is why we need Medicare for All.
"Yes. Trump's not alone.. . Federal income taxes paid by corporations a year after his tax plan was signed into law:. . $0: Amazon. $0: GM . $0: Netflix. $0: Chevron. $0: FedEx. $0: Eli Lilly. $0: Starbucks. . Dr. King was right. We have socialism for the rich, rugged capitalism for the rest."
"I'm proud to introduce the Medicare for All Act of 2019.. . It's simple: No deductibles, no surprise bills for out-of-network services, and no copays. And if you change jobs, no changing insurance plans or worrying about losing the coverage that you and your family depend on."
"FEMA must determine how, through mutual assistance agreements, utilities on the mainland can be of immediate help to Puerto Rico."
We're holding a major town hall on Dec. 3 to talk about one of the most pressing global crises facing us today: climate change. Will you be tuning in?
"No one should profit from imprisoning people, especially children.. . We must end this morally repugnant business."
"I said it in 1993 and I will say it again now: If you want a simpler, more cost-effective health care system, the way forward is a Medicare for all, single-payer program."
"Let’s be crystal clear. If the bipartisan infrastructure bill is passed on its own on Thursday, this will be in violation of an agreement that was reached within the Democratic Caucus in Congress."
"I look forward to an up-or-down vote next week to end U.S involvement in the disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen. I am confident that we have the bipartisan votes to pass the War Powers resolution in the Senate, which would be an historic step forward."
The war in Yemen is both a humanitarian and a strategic disaster. Let us bring this catastrophic and unconstitutional war in Yemen to an end today.
"LIVE: No more insurance premiums. No more deductibles. No more co-payments. Health care is right, not a privilege. It’s time for Medicare for All."
"We could eradicate HIV/AIDS in America. What’s standing in the way? The greed of the pharmaceutical industry.. . An $8 HIV drug in Australia costs $2,000 in America. That is immoral. We need affordable, generic HIV medicine. Now."
"Here's an idea for @JeffBezos: Instead of handing out t-shirts, maybe, as the richest man on Earth, you can provide all of your workers with paid sick leave, hazard pay, protective gear, and a safe and sanitary workplace."
"Unless Congress passes the reconciliation bill, the $300 monthly checks sent to every working family in America will expire in December. We cannot let that happen. These checks are a big reason why childhood poverty in America has been cut by 61%. No reconciliation bill, no deal."
"Donald Trump’s relentless attacks on our political institutions not only undermine our democracy, they also embolden authoritarian leaders around the world."
"The House will vote soon on our resolution to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, which has created the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Trump has said he opposes ""endless wars."" He can show us he means it by signing this resolution when it comes to his desk."
What do my Republican colleagues want to do to address the crises facing working families today? They want to give tax breaks to the wealthiest people in the country. That is obscene.
The United States government should use every tool available to lower outrageously high prescription drug prices. It's time to put the pharmaceutical industry on notice that the era of charging unconscionable prices must end.
America’s economic rise relied on treating Black people as literal property. We have not come to terms with the horrors of slavery and its continued impacts on our society. I am proud to cosponsor this bill to study and develop reparations proposals.
No one should be dying in the United States of America because they cannot afford their prescription drugs. Period.
"Republicans talk about choice, but they want to deny millions of women the right to choose Planned Parenthood for care. #HealthCareDebate"
"Today I met with courageous activists @ralmutawakel and @ralfaqih from Yemeni human rights group @mwatanaen. They talked about the crisis in Yemen, and how important it is to end U.S. support for this disastrous war."
"Looks like that $4,000 pay raise Trump promised working people from his tax cuts was just another lie he told to help enrich profitable corporations and billionaires."
"Second: Any legislation in the Senate to address the economic crisis must include a provision to guarantee 100 percent of the paychecks of workers up to $90,000 a year. This is what is being done successfully in many European countries and what should be done here."
"Like the swindler he is, the president used charity money for veterans to pay off his own debts. The American people recognize he is the most corrupt president in modern history. Now even Mr. Trump has admitted his corruption."
"We must oppose Mr. Trump's nightmarish mass-deportation plans. We must stop family separation, reunite families that have been separated, and eliminate private detention facilities. Know your rights. Conozca sus derechos."
This tax bill was written for Republicans’ wealthy campaign contributors. I want to congratulate my Republican colleagues for their honesty about that.
"I live 50 miles away from the Canadian border. You don't take out your wallet or your credit card when you go to the doctor or the hospital there.. . If Canada can provide health care to all its people at half the cost, we can join the rest of the world and pass Medicare for All."
"With 400,000 children now at risk of starvation in Yemen, the U.S. must tell the Saudis in no uncertain terms: immediately end the blockade and let humanitarian aid in. #YemenCantWait"
"It’s time for Congress to step up and, like Alabama and other states, investigate the pharmaceutical industry. The manufacturers of opioids should be forced to testify before Congress and tell us what they knew about the addictiveness of opioids."
"Corporate greed is Shell making a record $21 billion in profits over the last 2 quarters and spending $26 billion on stock buybacks and dividends this year to enrich its wealthy stockholders while working class Americans struggle to pay $4, $5, $6 for a gallon of gas."
"Mr. President, this is the exact opposite of what halting endless war looks like. Congress has not authorized you to use our troops to secure Syria’s oil.. . Read the Constitution, Article I."
"Trump's pathological dishonesty is undermining our democracy, setting a terrible example for our children and isolating us from our democratic allies around the world. Now is the time for the American people to fight back on every front."
"Unbelievably, hundreds of thousands of low-income Americans are in jail because they can't afford cash bail, or are unable to pay fines owed to local governments. We should be attempting to alleviate poverty, not jailing people because they are poor."
"If we are going to stop Republicans from taking health care from millions and slashing Medicare to give tax cuts to the wealthy and large corporations, NOW is the time to stand up and fight back."
"We are joining Disneyland workers today to say: If Disney can afford to pay its CEO up to $423 million, it can afford to pay all of its workers a living wage."
Half of our workers are living paycheck to paycheck and millions of people are working for starvation wages. We need the minimum wage to be a living wage and that’s why we’re going to raise it to $15 an hour.
This is a catastrophic loss of American lives. The Trump administration's response to the crisis in Puerto Rico has been disturbingly inadequate. We must use the full resources of the United States government to help the island recover.
Make no mistake about what is happening here: activist Aleksei Navalny is being murdered in front of the world by Vladimir Putin for the crime of exposing Putin’s vast corruption. Navalny’s doctors must be allowed to see him immediately.
The richest 400 Americans own $2.9 trillion—the size of the entire UK economy.. . These 400 billionaires pay a lower tax rate than the half of Americans living paycheck to paycheck.. . The rich have waged 45 years of class war. It’s about time working people stand up and fight back.
"This is what authoritarians do: @realDonaldTrump is taking $2.5 million away from our National Park Service to glorify himself with a spectacle of military tanks rolling through Washington. And top GOP donors are getting VIP seats, all at taxpayer expense."
"Understanding the horrors and lasting legacy of slavery is a critical step to making the changes we need in our world today..  . Today, on Juneteenth, we must recommit to building a nation based on justice and compassion."
Trump and Ted Cruz love to say that they’ll protect Americans with pre-exisiting conditions. So why do they keep pushing policies that do the opposite?
"Walmart workers are sick and tired of working for starvation wages. I say to the Walton family of Walmart, do what's right and pay your workers a living wage. (with @UFCW)"
30 million lost their jobs in six weeks.. . We are the only major country with millions unemployed and uninsured.. . It's time to reexamine our society's foundations and fight for a more just nation.. . This is the moment to make sure everyone has economic security and health care.
"Instead of Attorney General Sessions intensifying the failed war on drugs, states should be allowed to make their own decisions regarding the legalization or decriminalization of marijuana."
"Sen. Manchin is intentionally sabotaging the President’s agenda, what the American people want, and what the majority of us in the Democratic caucus want.. . He is not interested in representing the needs of the working class of this country."
"Reagan did slash taxes on the rich in 1981. But the deficit increased so much that he raised taxes in '82, '83, '84 and '87. #CNNDebateNight"
The public still doesn’t have 96% of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s documents. What are Republicans hiding?
It is insane and unacceptable that the Trump Administration has given the Gilead pharmaceutical corporation a seven-year monopoly on a potential coronavirus treatment.. . We will not tolerate profiteering. Any treatment or vaccine must be made free for all.
"This is the beginning of a bipartisan process to take back our responsibility over these most important matters. My likeminded colleagues and I, in a bipartisan fashion, will utilize all of the legislative tools at our disposal—including further use of the War Powers Act."
"When we take that next giant leap into space let us do it to benefit all of humanity, not to turn a handful of billionaires into trillionaires."
"I’m delighted that Mitch McConnell suddenly decided to care about “socialism for the rich”! That means the huge tax breaks for billionaires that he helped pass—not the $2,000 direct payments that America’s struggling working-class families desperately need."
"Meanwhile, in state houses and governor’s mansions across the country Republicans are shamefully working overtime to make it harder for poor people, people of color, young people and people with disabilities to participate in the American democratic system."
"The time is long overdue for Sen. Manchin to say with specificity - we're beyond generalities - what he wants, and what he does not want, and to explain that to the people of West Virginia and America."
This man's doctor told him to delay treatment because of insanely high costs.. . Now he recognizes what 70% of Americans already understand: We need to join the rest of the developed world. We need Medicare for All.
It is an absolute disgrace that a refugee agency protecting migrant children could be turned into part of Trump's deportation machine. This is not what America is about.
Is protecting working families and cutting childhood poverty an ‘entitlement’? Are the children of this country not entitled to high quality childcare and pre-K education? Are working families in this country are entitled to affordable housing?
"Today, Republicans pushed empty gestures on police reform. No. Enough lip service.. . Any serious effort must ban chokeholds, abolish legal immunity, create unarmed civilian first responders, and strip federal funds for police that violate civil rights."
"In America, 59% of our uninsured are people of color.. . Black mothers are three times likelier to die in childbirth as white mothers.. . My friend @RepJayapal is right: Medicare for All helps advance racial justice and provides comprehensive care to everyone."
"If McDonald's can find the money to spend over $20 billion on stock buybacks, they can find the money to pay their workers a living wage. It is time we stop subsidizing McDonald’s starvation wages."
"A political revolution is underway. . . On January 1, thanks to millions of working people engaging at all levels of government, 21 states and 26 localities will raise the minimum wage.. . This is the largest number of states, cities and counties raising the wage in American history."
Inequality is at a 100-year high. 400 billionaires pay lower taxes than fast-food workers. Wages have gone nowhere..  . The power elite need to come clean. Admit to the American people that the trickle-down economics you've sold us for 40 years is a racket.
I am once again asking President Biden to support a WTO waiver that would enable the sharing of life-saving vaccine technology with poorer countries. Join me LIVE now:
"On one hand, we see a worldwide movement toward authoritarianism, oligarchy, and kleptocracy. On the other hand, we see a movement toward strengthening democracy, egalitarianism, and justice. #SandersSAIS"
Millions of Americans are right now struggling with the outrageous cost of child care and education in this country. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Listen to what Finland’s Ambassador had to say about what it looks like when a nation gets its priorities right.
The people of Puerto Rico have been experiencing a humanitarian crisis for over a year and a half since Hurricane Maria. It is totally unconscionable that in the wealthiest nation in the world we have allowed our fellow citizens to suffer for so long.
"The richest Americans who are doing phenomenally well? Rewarded with tax breaks.. . The largest corporations enjoying record-breaking profits? Tax breaks.. . Americans in need of help? The Trump administration will cut nutrition support to 700,000 of them."
It is long due time we rebuild the trade union movement in this country.
"This bill cuts Medicaid, which covers 62% of nursing home residents, by hundreds of billions of dollars. #HealthCareDebate"
It is up to working people around the world to stand together to end the absurdity of spending trillions of dollars on war—while millions of children die from preventable diseases and billions of people live on pennies an hour.
"It's absolutely unacceptable that Louis DeJoy, a top campaign contributor of Donald Trump, is still the Postmaster General. He should have been fired a long time ago. We need new leadership who will fight to strengthen and expand the Postal Service, not undermine and sabotage it."
"Trump is kicking 700,000 hungry people off nutrition assistance. But the holiday spirit is alive and well when it comes to taxpayer giveaways to billionaires.. . There's a name for this kind of system: oligarchy. @RepRashida and I believe we must fight back."
We should not be attacking and disparaging the women who have come forward with serious allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. Trump's comments are disgusting.
"President Trump announced he will keep troops in Syria to protect oil fields. Last I checked, Congress never authorized U.S. forces to be deployed to secure Syria’s economic resources. Putting U.S. forces in harm’s way for this purpose is illegal and unconstitutional."
"As the occupying power, Israel is responsible for the health of all the people under its control. It is outrageous that Netanyahu would use spare vaccines to reward his foreign allies while so many Palestinians in the occupied territories are still waiting."
"I think it is pretty sick to knowingly sell a product that will destroy the planet and our children's futures, but that is the mindset of a fossil fuel billionaire. It's time for a Green New Deal and an end to this disease of lying for profit."
Here we go! #ClimateTownHall. . Watch here:
"Since 2001, over 50,000 factories have been shut down in America. #InequalityTownHall"
You know what is the most popular health insurance program in the country? Medicare! #HealthCareDebate
"In 1973, public college tuition, room and board cost $8,200 a year. Today it's $22,000.. . Wages hardly grew, college costs nearly tripled.. . It's time to treat higher education, like K-12 schooling, as a right. We must make public colleges tuition free and cancel all student debt."
The American people deserve to know which side their elected officials are on. It is time for the Senate to vote on legislation that addresses the needs of working families. We must challenge Republicans to vote against these important and popular initiatives.
"Today and every day, our workers deserve $15 an hour, decent working conditions and the right to form a union. #BlackFriday"
"Today, on this Memorial Day, we remember and honor all those men and women who gave their lives to defend our country, American values and our democracy. Their sacrifice will not be forgotten."
"Make no mistake: this is a major victory for democracy and a defeat for the xenophobic Trump Administration. The Census is supposed to count everyone, including immigrants. When we stand together and fight back, we can defeat Trump's bigotry."
"Our time on this Earth is precious. Let us honor the tremendous strength and courage of @AdyBarkan by watching his moving testimony, sharing it widely, and working tirelessly to pass #MedicareforAll to guarantee health care to every man, woman and child."
"Without Congressional authorization, our engagement in the war in Yemen should be restricted to providing desperately needed humanitarian aid, and diplomatic efforts to resolve it."
"At around 7:15 p.m. ET tonight, I'll be LIVE on the floor of the U.S. Senate to talk about the Inflation Reduction Act."
Here is why I voted against Republicans' short-term spending bill today:
"A free, open internet is critical to democracy. We can't allow major telecom companies to have greater control over the information we get."
"A new United Nations report confirms what the CIA said: Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. It is time for the United States to reevaluate our relationship with this brutal regime, including ending support for the catastrophic Yemen war."
"If we can afford to give out tax breaks for the rich and large corporations, we can afford to address the needs of the working class. Period."
"@SpeakerRyan Paul Ryan has been dreaming of cutting benefits for working families since he was ""drinking at a keg."" That's not something to be proud of."
6 months after Hurricane Maria we are still seeing a humanitarian crisis with schools being closed and people struggling to get clean drinking water. 1 in 10 people in Puerto Rico still have no electricity – in the wealthiest nation on earth. That is a disgrace.
"I'm proud of my home state of Vermont for reaffirming the right to abortion, at a time when Roe v. Wade is under attack by right-wing extremists across the country..  . We cannot go back to the days when women did not have the right to control their own bodies."
All of us can be a little forgetful sometimes. My Republican friends launched trillion-dollar wars and passed huge tax cuts for the rich. Then they ask why the deficit went up.
"10) But instead of talking to any of these experts, the corporate fact checkers are blindly trusting the author of the Mercatus report even though his previous studies have been called “misleading,” “arbitrary,” “discredited,” “mighty odd” and “bogus.”"
"Since her nomination by the President, and throughout the hearings, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson has handled herself with dignity and intelligence – more than can be said of her critics. I’ll be voting for her and I’m confident she'll be an outstanding Supreme Court Justice."
"Since the 1990s, the financial sector has spent over $3.2 billion on campaign contributions, and last year alone spent over $200 million on lobbying. #InequalityTownHall"
"If Prime Minister @Netanyahu doesn't want members of Congress to visit Israel, then maybe he can respectfully decline $3.8 billion in annual funding—the largest amount of U.S. aid to any country.. . I believe in an even-handed approach to ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
"Today while we remember the lives lost on 9/11, we must also honor the courageous men and women who continue to serve and die in Afghanistan, Iraq and many other places, and consider whether these wars—the longest in our history—have made us safer."
"Today on Yom HaShoah we remember the 6 million Jews murdered in the Holocaust and recommit ourselves to the fight against anti-Semitism, bigotry and intolerance."
"America can give tax breaks to billionaires, no problem. But somehow when it comes to workers' rights, we are the worst among major countries.. . Here's a radical idea: Maybe working people in the wealthiest country on Earth should get to live with dignity."
"A worker today would need to make nearly 3 times the minimum wage in order to afford an average one-bedroom apartment.. . That makes no sense to me, nor do I think it makes sense to the American people."
"A furloughed German worker retains 90-100% of his salary, while his American counterpart is struggling to obtain unemployment benefits.. . Unacceptable. Congress must cover the paychecks of every U.S. worker."
Trump and his friends weren't satisfied with giving away trillions of dollars to the rich—now they're trying to take food out of the mouths of a million needy schoolchildren across America.. . We have got to stand together and defeat their disgusting agenda.
Republicans love talking about Reagan's major tax cut in 1981. They fail to mention he raised taxes 10 times thereafter. #TaxDebate
The fate of the planet is at stake. Without a strong reconciliation bill there will be no serious effort to cut carbon emissions & transform our energy system away from fossil fuel. There must be no infrastructure bill without a major reconciliation bill to combat climate change.
"Donald Trump claims Democrats want to ""destroy your Social Security.” . . Surprise! He's lying. . . His own economic advisor just admitted the Trump administration is looking at cutting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid next year."
"We need a national policy, based upon science, which helps states and communities go forward—bring workers back, bring kids back to school, if necessary—but do so in a safe way that does not needlessly sacrifice thousands of lives."
"Republicans think I don’t do much for them, but I’m trying to bring Mitch McConnell’s bill to the floor! All I ask is we also vote on the House-passed bill for $2,000 survival checks.. . It’s hard for me to understand why Republicans would object to voting on a Republican bill."
"My friend Rep. Tlaib is right. At a time when hand-washing is saving lives, no one should be denied water—period."
The time is now for Congress to stand up to the pharmaceutical industry which over the last 20 years spent over $4.5 billion on lobbying and hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign contributions. Join us LIVE at 5:30pm ET as we take the fight to the floor of the U.S. Senate.
"Donald Trump has gotten:. . -$885 million in subsidies for his real estate empire. -$287 million of his debt canceled. -A $72.9 million IRS tax refund. -Free health care at a 100% government run hospital. . Yes. Trump l-o-v-e-s socialism for himself, rugged individualism for the rest."
This president’s erratic and impulsive behavior is a danger to our country and a major impediment in terms of addressing the crises we face. His decision to shut down the government is just the latest example of this destructive pattern.
"Last year, Amazon reported nearly $5.6 billion in U.S. profits and did not pay a penny of federal income taxes on it. #CEOsvsWorkers"
"As a result, the top 1% would pay lower taxes after passage of the Build Back Better plan than they did after the Trump tax cut in 2017. This is beyond unacceptable."
"You will forgive me for not having a lot of patience when some of my colleagues in the Senate tell me that we can’t afford to act on climate change. Really? The question that we must be asking, as loudly as possible, is how we can afford not to act?"
"Over 30,000 Americans could die every single year if Trump gets his way and destroys the Affordable Care Act. .  . Our job is to fight back against his efforts to take health care away from millions of people. We must make health care a right through Medicare for All."
"""Less than lethal""? What a joke. These weapons are fracturing people's skulls, destroying their eyeballs, and harming their lungs.. . Enough. We must ban the use of rubber bullets, tear gas and pepper spray on protesters across the country."
"With unprecedented fires, drought, heat waves, floods and extreme weather disturbances, what's radical is not transforming our energy systems away from fossil fuel and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy. What's radical is doing nothing as our planet gets destroyed."
"Even with private health insurance, Kim Leighton is still paying thousands of dollars for life-saving health care. Our system is broken. We need Medicare for all."
"""I know smart, talented, debt-laden millennials who graduated into a post-Great Recession job market so mean and miserly that it literally had them eating out of Dumpsters."" #CancelStudentDebt"
"I'm proud to stand with Vermont nurses in their fight for a fair contract that treats them with respect and dignity. At the end of the day, this struggle is about priorities. It’s about prioritizing patient care over profits."
It's extremely concerning that the person charged with administering Medicare would rather throw 32 million Americans off of health insurance than join every major nation and guarantee health care as a fundamental right.
"When ordinary people stand up and fight for justice there is nothing that we cannot accomplish. That has been the history of America, and that is our future. #BernieResponds"
"According to a recent AP article, Sen. @MittRomney, reflecting the views I think of many “said that when other countries subsidize the manufacturing of high technology chips, the U.S. must join the club.”"
"Married couples making under $150,000 & single parents making less than $112,500 will receive a monthly payment of $300 per child under 6 and $250 per child between ages 6 and 17 for the next 6 months, with the rest of the benefit to be received as part of next year’s tax return."
"Big Pharma lied about opioid addictiveness. And here they are, joking about their racket in these emails. Their greed has no limits. We must pass the Opioid Crisis Accountability Act to hold top executives criminally liable for the devastation they caused."
"We spend less than 2.5% of our gross domestic product each year on infrastructure, while Europe spends double that rate and China four times as much.. . Why do we spend trillions on never ending wars but can't afford to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure?"
"The people of Venezuela are enduring a serious humanitarian crisis. The Maduro government must put the needs of its people first, allow humanitarian aid into the country, and refrain from violence against protesters."
"Let me thank Speaker Pelosi for recognizing the enormity of the coronavirus crisis and coming up with a number of important proposals.. . In my view, the Senate must improve this bill to adequately address two urgent needs: health care and economic security."
"If Brett Kavanaugh knew about Deborah Ramirez's allegation of sexual assault before the publication of the Sept. 23 New Yorker story, then he lied to Congress. That's a federal crime."
"In the richest country in the history of the world, our teachers should be the best-paid in the developed world, not among the worst-paid. The teachers who are protesting now are an inspiration to all of us."
"While the United States is the wealthiest country in history, we rank 57th in infant mortality. That is an absolute disgrace."
"America has lost Little Richard, one of the inventors of rock and roll. He was a brilliant performer who broke down barriers and inspired millions of people around the world. Rest in peace."
Millions of Americans have risked their lives to defend our democracy. What would those brave men and women think if they saw President Trump's pathetic performance today?
"Addiction is a disease, not criminal activity.. . Here's who should be held criminally liable: The top executives of the opioid manufacturers who lied by pushing a product they knew was addictive on doctors and patients, causing a national public health emergency."
"I wish everyone a happy Thanksgiving. This has been a tough year, but we can move forward in a direction based on generosity and love."
I have long believed the U.S. must responsibly end our military interventions in the Middle East. But Trump’s abrupt announcement to withdraw from northern Syria and endorse Turkey’s incursion is extremely irresponsible. It is likely to result in more suffering and instability.
"Today, I will ask that the Senate vote yes or no on two bills: . . 1. The House passed $2,000 survival checks . 2. Mitch McConnell’s alternative bill. . What objection could he possibly have to voting on his own bill? Let the Senate vote on $2,000 checks, Mitch!"
Will Jeff Bezos have the guts to face Amazon workers at our town hall tonight at 7 pm ET and explain why he's worth $151 billion but won't pay them a living wage?
I’ll be LIVE on the floor of the Senate floor today at 2:30pm ET to oppose a bill that hands $53 billion to profitable microchip companies. The people of this country are sick and tired of corporate greed. We must stand with them.
"Look, I’m a bit old-fashioned. I happen to believe we should do what the people are demanding, and what the people are demanding is that we finally take on the ruling class of this country."
Spread the word: You can sign up for health insurance starting today. Go to to choose a plan and get covered.
"Unions don't just mean better wages and benefits. Workers organize to protect each other from abusive bosses, harassment and discrimination. .  . I stand in solidarity with these employees fighting for a fair workplace on behalf of all workers at NBC."
I'm sorry Mr. Bezos won't join our hearing on income and wealth inequality. As the wealthiest person on earth I'd love to hear his reasoning as to why he is vigorously opposing a union organizing effort at Amazon which would improve wages and benefits for struggling workers.
"Mr. Trump, you are dead wrong. This is not a ""hot economy"" when 62 percent of jobs in America cannot support a middle class life."
"Unlike commercial television, this event is not sponsored by Exxon Mobil. Nor is it paid or sponsored by the Koch brothers, who made most of their fortune in the fossil fuel industry. #ClimateTownHall"
"We will all be safer when we are all vaccinated. But right now, fewer than 3% of people in low-income countries have been vaccinated. We must take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and grant a temporary patent waiver to unlock vaccine production in developing countries."
"To be politically successful, Trump needs to create enemies and divide us up. He needs to turn men against women, white against black, straight against the LGBT community, Christian against Muslim, native born against immigrant. We will not let him win."
"""A democracy cannot function effectively when its constituent members believe laws are being bought and sold."" This was Justice John Paul Stevens’ prophetic dissent against Citizens United. During his tenure on the Supreme Court, he was astute and fair. We will miss him."
It makes no sense to simply put things back the way they were in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. We have to help the islands build back stronger.
3) What Tapper and others have done is say we're wrong because Blahous didn't actually intend to find that Medicare for All would be a great deal for Americans. The problem is: Blahous did find it would save $2 trillion – he just doesn't like that people are celebrating it.
"For the THIRD time this year, the GOP blocked common sense voting rights legislation in the Senate. After failing to win the last election, they are doing all they can to steal the next one. What a disgrace. We are going to protect and expand voting rights in this country."
"This is what happened:. . 1) The Senate unanimously voted to keep the government open. 2) The House was ready to pass the bill. 3) Rush and Fox & Friends criticized Trump. 4) Trump now wants to shut down the government, putting 800,000 people out of work the week before Christmas"
Everybody in America must understand that the scientists are telling us we have very little time to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to prevent future disasters. The time to address the climate crisis is NOW.
"By a vote of 51 to 49, the Senate refused to subpoena witnesses in this impeachment trial.. . I've never heard of a trial where you don't have witnesses.. . This is a sad day in American history."
Danny Glover wants to tell you why democracy is under threat in Brazil.
"The undemocratic fiscal control board of Puerto Rico is still working hand in hand with Wall Street, with a plan for more austerity and slashed pensions. The board must stop dictating Puerto Rico’s economic decisions and let the people decide their future."
This new rule is a disgraceful assault on women's right and an assault on millions of Americans' ability to get the health care they need. Title X funds provide much-needed family planning services for millions of people. Congress must take action to overturn the final rule.
"Since 1985, the average Wall Street bonus has gone up 1,217%. If the federal minimum wage had increased at the same rate as Wall Street bonuses, it would be $44/hour. Instead, it's remained stuck at $7.25 an hour for 12 years. We must raise the minimum wage to at least $15/hour."

"You've got questions—@RepJayapal, @Ilhan and I have got answers. How do we cancel $1.6 trillion in student debt? We pay for it in a very simple way: a small tax on Wall Street speculation. This is not a ""radical"" idea."
Over the next decade we will spend nearly $1 trillion jailing our fellow citizens. Imagine what we could accomplish if we reduced that number by 10 or 20 percent?
"The news about bombing attempts against President Obama, Secretary Clinton, George Soros, CNN, various Democratic officials and others is gravely disturbing. While many more details will come to light, these deeply un-American acts of violence have no place in our democracy."
People are sick and tired of being exploited. People are sick and tired of those on top having so much power over everybody else. The time for transformational change is NOW.
Future generations will ask us what we did to stop the climate crisis. What will we tell them?
"This initiative from the Biden administration to give Americans high-quality, reusable masks without cost at community health centers, food pantries and soup kitchens will save tens of thousands of lives – period."
"In terms of Iraq, we were told that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, that he was working with Al Qaeda, and that we needed to invade Iraq unless we wanted to see another 9/11, or even worse, a nuclear attack.. . Those claims were lies."
"The Republican Party's lust for power and political gain is so great that they are prepared to default on the debt they voted for under Trump, and plunge the world's economy into chaos and depression. To call that ""irresponsible"" would be a major understatement."
"Trump's Earth Day plans? Ignore science, exploit a pandemic to roll back environmental protections, and hand out favors to the fossil fuel industry.. . Let us celebrate the 50th #EarthDay by standing together and tackling these crises head on."
Our world is beautiful and fragile. We must put our energies into building the political power we need to solve the problem of climate change before it is too late.
Republicans say they're worried about the deficit. But they'll support a tax plan with $269B in breaks for the top 0.2%. #HealthCareDebate
"Pharmaceutical corporate greed is literally killing people who cannot afford their medication. Together, we can change that. @SSWorks"
"Here is the untold story of the global economy. Oligarchy reigns and is getting worse. Today, the 10 richest people own more wealth than the bottom 3.1 billion. We need progressive global taxation and an economy that works for all, not a tiny handful of multi-billionaires."
"The Trump admin, in its unabashed cruelty, is carving out a unique place in American history. It's not just support for racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia and religious bigotry. They've hit a new low by separating kids from their parents and placing them in detention centers."
Congratulations to advocates in Richmond who won this ballot measure to restrict coal exports. I stand with the communities who are fighting fossil fuel CEOs every step of the way.. . Our job: Break our addiction to fossil fuels and create millions of family-sustaining clean jobs.
There is no greater example of how politics works in America than this:
"No, Mr. President. Dr. Fauci has not been a ""disaster."" He has been an extraordinary public servant. You have been a disaster.. . We will not solve the COVID crisis until we have a president who believes in science—not one who regurgitates right-wing conspiracy theories."
"If Wall Street bankers are annoyed with their ""underwhelming"" bonuses right now, just wait until we pass my Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act."
Our pattern of doing nothing after mass shootings must end. Gun violence in America is a major crisis which must be addressed.
A vote for the Republican tax bill is a vote to take health insurance away from millions of Americans.
Billionaires get tax breaks. Teachers get broken chairs and flooded classrooms. As the wealthiest nation in history we've got to do better.
"Let us invest in jobs and education, not jails and incarceration."
"The American people do not want endless war. It is the job of Congress to responsibly end these military interventions and bring our troops home, not to come up with more reasons to continue them."
"Republicans cannot ignore the reality that 800,000 Dreamers will start losing their legal status in a few months."
"The American people are tired of a health care system that works for Wall Street investors, insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry—but ignores their needs. They want to move to a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system."
"If Trump was serious about protecting good American jobs, which he is not, he would sign an executive order today to deny federal contracts to companies that outsource American jobs overseas."
"Vermont just got a HUGE investment in our community health centers. Nearly one-in-three Vermonters rely on them, and $33 million is an enormous amount of money. It represents a huge leap forward for Vermonters’ health care."
Today we took a clear stand against war and famine and for Congress’ war powers by voting to end our complicity in the war in Yemen..  . This is just the beginning of a national debate over when and where we go to war and Congress’ authority over those interventions.
"As the son of an immigrant, I congratulate the countless activists who made today’s Supreme Court decision possible. . . Together, we will reverse all the cruel things Trump has done to harm immigrants and ensure a pathway to citizenship for all undocumented people in America."
We want to hear from ordinary Americans who have experienced in their daily lives the consequences of an economy that leaves far too many behind. Please share your story.
"Today is #EarthDay. Unless we take bold action to reverse climate change, future generations will look back and ask a very simple question: ""Where were they? Why didn’t the United States of America lead on preventing the devastating damage that scientists were sure would come?"""
"McDonald’s worker in the US: $9/hr. . McDonald’s worker in Denmark: $22/hr, 6 weeks of annual vacation, a union, 1 year of paid family leave, life insurance and pension.. . America must join the rest of the industrialized world and ensure that our working class can live with dignity."
"What President Trump is saying is, ""I cannot lose this election. If I win, great. If I lose, it's rigged.”. . This is a major effort to undermine our democracy and our election system.. . We have got to make it clear to Donald Trump: If you lose, you're leaving office. Period."
"Mr. Trump and his cabinet cannot seem to get on the same page when it comes to raising the min. wage to $15 an hour. It is not that complicated: Too many Americans are working 40+ hours a week and still cannot afford basic necessities. They need a living wage, not poverty pay."
"Throughout our history, the Postal Service and its unions have been vital institutions providing a pathway into the middle class for working families, particularly communities of color. I stand with @mrdannyglover: we will not allow @USPS to be privatized."
Trickle-down economics has always been a fraud. It is an idea propagated by big-money interests to give an intellectual veneer for more tax breaks for billionaires.
Spread the word: Saturday is the last day of open enrollment to sign up for health insurance. Go to to choose a plan and get covered.
"This whole debate over immigration and the Dreamers has become somewhat personal for me, because it has reminded me…"
"Trump said he’d get us “crystal clean water” and the “purest air on the planet.”. . His EPA is working to let polluters dump more mercury, pesticides, and fossil fuel emissions into our environment. Our people will get sicker.. . We must defeat the agenda of this pathological liar."
Trump must make good on his promise to sign a bill protecting Dreamers. I won't vote for any spending bill without a permanent DACA fix.
"Today at 11am ET, we will hold the first ever hearing in a full committee of the U.S. Senate on Medicare for All. Health care is a right, not a privilege."
More Black and Latino people are dying from coronavirus because air pollution is worse in their communities. That is unconscionable.. . It is not a radical idea that clean air and water should be the right of all Americans regardless of income and skin
"Americans are entitled to an efficient, well-run postal service with high-quality mail delivery standards. That is why Postmaster General DeJoy should be removed from office."
"The American people cannot afford to wait another month. Here is what we must do: . . In order to avoid another Great Depression, the Senate must pass legislation requiring the government to guarantee 100 percent of the paychecks and benefits of American workers up to $90,000/year."
I am more than a little tired of the United States being the only major country on Earth to not guarantee paid family and medical leave. We are going to end that international embarrassment.
"11,258 scientists from 153 countries came together to say: ""Scientists have a moral obligation to clearly warn humanity of any catastrophic threat and tell it like it is."" .  . It's time we listen. Congress must declare a climate emergency and act boldly to protect our only home."
"140,000 workers lost their jobs last month & real unemployment is close to 12%. Millions more face hunger, eviction & crushing debt. In the midst of this economic desperation, Congress must act boldly & aggressively. As the next Budget Committee Chair, that's what I intend to do."
"The CIA has confirmed what was obvious, that Jamal Khashoggi was murdered at the direction of the Saudi crown prince. The United States must thoroughly reevaluate our relationship with the brutal Saudi dictatorship, and start by ending support for the catastrophic war in Yemen."
"On this Yom HaShoah, we remember the 6 million Jews who were murdered by the Nazis in the Holocaust. At a time of rising antisemitism, racism, and xenophobia, we must honor them today and every day by standing together against all forms of hate, bigotry, and intolerance."
"I am on the Senate floor to introduce a bipartisan amendment to provide $1,200 in direct payments to working-class adults and $500 to each of their kids. In the midst of this pandemic, Congress cannot go on recess without providing this relief."
"As many as 22 million people—double the populations of New York City and Chicago combined—could be displaced by global warming this year. . . When we say that climate change is an emergency, this is what @AOC, @RepBlumenauer and I are talking about."
"Moral policy is good politics. When you stand up for working families and protect future generations, that not only is the right thing to do, but it is also what the American people want."
"I am proud to stand with these civil rights organizations. In the fight for marijuana legalization, we must prioritize racial and economic justice—that means revenues from this industry must be invested in the communities that have been devastated by the so-called ""war on drugs."""
A fair impeachment trial means hearing testimony from witnesses. . . This is not a radical idea..  . So what are Republicans afraid of?
".@UEUnion workers from #UE506 line up to vote to authorize a strike if necessary as negotiations with Wabtec breakdown. . . At stake: weekends, family sustaining wages, job security and 80 years of workers’ rights. . . I stand with #UE506 and working Americans everywhere."
Senate Republicans' partisan coronavirus package is outrageous:. . ❌Creates a slush fund for corporate bailouts. ❌Does nothing to protect patients from huge bills. ❌Denies millions of workers paid sick leave. ❌Keeps state and local governments underfunded . . We must do much better.
"There is no border crisis. The real crisis is that 800,000 people don’t know how they’ll pay their mortgages, pay student loans, put gas in their cars or put food on the table because of Donald Trump’s government shutdown."
"The greed and impunity of the richest 1% is costing us $5,000,000,000,000. . . America's wealthiest and most powerful people cannot be above the law. They must pay the taxes they already owe, just like working Americans."
"This is oligarchy. This is greed. This is callousness. Last year, over 2 million people worldwide died of hunger. At the same time, the world’s 2,755 billionaires saw their wealth go up by $5 trillion – from $8.6 trillion to $13.8 trillion. This is why we need a tax on wealth."
There's little left to be said about the horrific school shooting tragedies that we've seen over and over – today in Texas. These are very sick acts. . . Congress and Trump must finally have the courage to stand up to the NRA and do what the American people want. Enough is enough!
"Charles Koch to Paul Ryan: Here's $500K for giving me a massive tax cut at working families' expense.. . Also Charles Koch: “When large companies can pressure politicians to force everyday Americans to fork over unearned millions, we should all question the fairness of the system.”"
"Our full resources must be brought to bear on the humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico, for as long as necessary, to help our fellow citizens."
"""When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, materialism and militarism are incapable of being conquered.” -Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Riverside Church, 1967"
"While we do not need more evidence to show us that pipelines are dangerous and must be stopped, more keeps coming."
How a country deals with health care for its citizens isn't just about about medicine or technology. It's about its core values as a nation.
Here's what happened when a Republican senator challenged a Canadian doctor on their single-payer health care system.
"President Trump said yesterday he did a ""fantastic job"" in Puerto Rico. Meanwhile, new estimates put the death toll from Hurricane Maria at nearly 3,000. This is a disgrace."
"We have a president who is a racist.. . Today we say to Trump: We aren't going back to more bigotry, discrimination and division. We're going forward."
.@xiuhtezcatl joins the panel to talk about how we can rally the next generation to end our dependency on fossil fuels. #ClimateTownHall
More than 2 out of 3 Disneyland workers say they go hungry. That does not sound like the “happiest place on Earth” to me.
"In this crisis, what the American people want is for us to use our taxpayer dollars in every way that we can to protect the working families of this country and the 50 percent of Americans who are living paycheck to paycheck, not just the billionaires and large corporations."
How the hell can debt-collecting vultures still be allowed to garnish people’s wages at a time like this?. . I have a radical idea: maybe Congress should stand up for ordinary people in the middle of a pandemic and stop all debt collection right now.
"9) Ernie Tedeschi, a former economist at the Treasury Department has also pointed out that the Mercatus study shows that Medicare for All will reduce national health expenditures by $2 trillion over 10 years."
"At a time of massive wealth and income inequality, Trump's tax plan is morally repugnant and bad economic policy."
How does it happen that companies which are owned by some of the wealthiest people in this country have workers not making enough money to feed their families and live in dignity? That is an issue the mainstream media has got to address.
"This economic crisis is unprecedented. The solution is straightforward: Keep everyone on their employers' payrolls, getting their regular paychecks and benefits.. . Congress must pass our Paycheck Security Act and put an end to mass unemployment."
"When I was in the House of Representatives, all the corporations in the world were telling us how great NAFTA would be. I did not buy it. I was right.. . I will not support any deal that makes American workers compete against people earning pennies an hour."
The Saudis said Jamal Khashoggi’s murder was a ‘rogue operation.’ That was a lie. . . A new piece reveals the regime’s ongoing efforts to harass and kidnap its critics around the world. It's past time to rethink our relationship with this repressive regime.
Watch @docdanielle debunk the myth that Canadians have their health care decisions decided by the government.
Marijuana should be legal nationwide. All marijuana convictions must be expunged. It is absurd that the federal government considers marijuana to be as dangerous as heroin.
The American people are tired of our broken health care system. Poll after poll shows that the majority of Americans know that we can do better and that we should pass Medicare for all to finally make health care a right.
"At a time of massive wealth and income inequality, we can no longer tolerate a rigged tax system that allows the top 1% to avoid $163 billion in taxes that they owe. Yes, we will demand that the 1% pays its fair share and we will use that revenue to invest in working families."
.@SenSchumer and I are here to say: corporations must address the needs of workers before the interests of wealthy stockholders. Our bill will prohibit corporations from buying back stock unless they invest in workers and communities first.
I support the flight attendants. The Trump Administration must stop putting up road blocks to this aid.. . The airline grants must be immediately released to fully fund the paychecks and benefits of 2 million workers. Workers need help and they need it now.
"Do Facebook, Amazon, Google and other tech giants pose a threat to American democracy? Join us for a discussion of that question and more with @linamkhan and @sarahmillerdc of the Open Markets Institute."
"Today I urge, in the strongest possible terms, that the Republican leadership in the Senate accept its responsibility and not allow the government to shut down."
"The United States is virtually the only country on earth that allows pharmaceutical companies to jack up the price of a life-saving cancer drug by 1,400%. This is an outrage."
"Poverty is not a crime and hundreds of thousands of Americans, convicted of nothing, should not be in jail today because they cannot afford bail. with @CFBurdeen and @shaunking"
"Follow me on Snapchat as we take on the GOP Tax Scam in Kentucky, Ohio and Pennsylvania this weekend."
"Medicare for All is not a crazy idea.. . What's crazy is that our health care system is designed to make as much profit for insurance and pharma executives as possible, while ordinary people die because they can't afford the care and medicine they need."
Buried in the Republican tax plan are hidden provisions designed to stick it to the poor and working class while the rich and corporations get billions of dollars in breaks.
"Walmart's CEO, Doug McMillon, made more than $22 million in compensation lsat year—or almost $11,000 an hour. #CEOsvsWorkers"
My colleague @RepAOC and I have a radical idea: maybe Congress should stand up for ordinary people. Join us at noon today on Twitter as we launch our legislation to protect consumers and take on the greed of the big banks.
"This is called oligarchy: government of, by, and for the billionaire class."
"Thank you Elle Purrier St. Pierre for taking Vermont into the 1,500-meter Olympic finals.  Your hard work and dedication is an inspiration to the young people of Vermont and America. Keep up the great work!"
Millions of Americans like Mario who want to organize unions are unable to do so because of the coercive and often illegal behavior of their employers. That has got to stop.
"Due to the failure of the federal government, 33,000 roofs still have blue tarps almost two years after Hurricane María. We must commit full resources to prepare our fellow citizens for the worst and stand with them for as long as is necessary to finally help rebuild Puerto Rico."
"Thank you, Toronto. I’m proud to join with you in the global fight for universal health care."
"The Bolivian people made their voices heard in yesterday’s election after a difficult, year-long fight to restore democracy. As minister of economy, Mr. Arce helped slash poverty and inequality. I congratulate him on his victory and wish him well."
"Although Trump thinks his administration did a ""fantastic job"" handling the destruction in Puerto Rico, the crisis is far from over."
"""When we prescribe medications for patients, it's a circus."" For one patient a medication may cost $4, for another it may cost $1,2000, depending on insurance, says nurse practitioner Deborah Wachtel #MedicareForAll"
"While fossil fuel companies get rich off destroying our planet for future generations, American taxpayers are forced to cough up $15 billion per year in direct federal subsidies to the fossil fuel industry. How does that make sense?"
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: It is outrageous that the Walton family makes more in one minute than a Walmart worker earns in a year. It is not radical to end taxpayer subsidies for this wealthy corporation and have it pay its employees a living wage of $15 an hour.
"Instead of spending another $70 billion on the military, we could be helping millions of students by making public colleges tuition-free."
91 of America's richest corporations paid $0 in taxes on $100 billion in profits.. . 40% of America can't afford a $400 emergency.. . What Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said in 1968 is just as true today: This country has socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for the poor.
Discrimination has no place in our military or society. It is my hope that this temporary ruling will not be the final outcome. We must stand with trans service members. Trump's efforts to divide us will not succeed.
"When I say Trump is a pathological liar, what do I mean? He promised to ""always protect"" Medicare and Social Security last week. Yesterday, he released a budget to:. . ⚠️Cut Social Security by over $24 billion. ⚠️Cut Medicare by $500 billion . ⚠️Cut Medicaid by $900 billion. . Obscene."
"I want to congratulate Jeff Bezos for doing exactly the right thing by raising the minimum wage at Amazon and Whole Foods to $15 an hour.. . Let me thank the hundreds of Amazon workers who contacted my office and the Fight for $15 movement, which has been leading this effort."
"It's been 76 days since Trump and Senate Republicans ended the $600 unemployment lifeline for millions of workers trying to survive this crisis..  . Now, instead of passing relief for the working class, McConnell is ramming through Trump's far-right Supreme Court nominee. Pathetic."
Yesterday my colleagues and I sent a letter to Sec. Tillerson asking him to make it easier to send U.S. aid for Iranian earthquake relief. The U.S. has routinely offered to help the Iranian people in times of need. This time should be no different.
"Seven decades ago, the British people put in place a system that treats health care as a human right. Today they live longer than Americans, infant mortality is lower, and they spend half of what we do on health care.. . It’s time we join the rest of the industrialized world."
"Working people in this country are living in great desperation, so of course selfish billionaires are buying ads to try and stop the relief bill. Sorry, Charles Koch. We’re going to pass this legislation, and then we’ll make sure you pay your fair share in taxes."
"As 2018 comes to an end, Jane and I want to wish all of you a happy New Year's Eve and a healthy and wonderful new year."
How would Trump's latest Supreme Court nominee rule on Roe v. Wade? Let candidate Donald Trump give you a hint.
"Tonight the House acted to:. . ✓ Protect workers from being illegally fired for union activities. ✓ Strengthen collective bargaining. ✓ Undo “Right to Work for Less"" laws. ✓ Defend the right to strike. . This is an important step to leveling the playing field for working people."

"Thousands of people in Puerto Rico were denied the right to vote yesterday.. . To ensure every vote is counted during this pandemic, we must protect the Postal Service and mail-in ballots and make sure local governments have the money they need to run safe, secure elections."
"Wealth of Mark Zuckerberg in 2009: $2 billion. . Wealth of Mark Zuckerberg today: $122 billion.  . Yes. It's time to break up Facebook, break up Big Tech & demand that the wealthy & powerful pay their fair share of taxes. We cannot continue to let Facebook put profits over safety."
"Unless we successfully combat climate change, the massive wildfires, hurricanes, floods and drought we have experienced will become more frequent, more severe and more damaging. No more excuses. We need to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel NOW and save the planet."
"While 90 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured and while 600,000 died in the pandemic, the CEOs of six health insurance companies made a combined $236 million in 2020, 45% more than in 2019. This is why we need Medicare for All."
"Let's be clear:. . The top 1% & large corporations did NOT need a $1 trillion tax break.. . The U.S. did NOT need to spend $6 trillion on endless wars.. . The billionaire class does NOT need to pay a lower tax rate than the bottom 90%.. . The working class NEEDS a $2,000 survival check."
Sen. Sanders holds press conference on Amazon $15 minimum wage:
"In America, I have met with low-income women who give birth and then have to go back to work in a week or two because they don't have the money to stay home. We are going to end that international embarrassment. We are going to have guaranteed paid family and medical leave."
"Vladimir Putin’s latest invasion of Ukraine is an indefensible violation of international law, regardless of whatever false pretext he offers. There has always been a diplomatic solution to this situation. Tragically, Putin appears intent on rejecting it."
"The Koch brothers and billionaire donors want these tax cuts very badly. In fact, @SenTedCruz just met with them."
"There is overwhelming support for ending starvation wages in America, and two-thirds of people believe we must raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. The Congress must act, and act NOW."
"Do not tell me a $15-an-hour living wage is a ""radical"" idea. It has 66% support in Democratic districts. It has 59% support in Republican districts.. . Giving 32 million workers a raise is not a partisan issue—it is common sense. Now let's get it done."
Stopping Republicans' bill isn't enough. We cannot continue to be the only major nation not to see health care as a right. #HealthCareDebate
"Veterans have been clear that they support strengthening the V.A., not slowly dismantling it by directing resources outside the V.A. system."
"Billions around the world are at risk of drought, displacement, and resource wars. . . What if, instead of spending $738 billion a year on the Pentagon and weapons systems, the United States brought the world together to cooperate on solving climate change?"

"You know what Trump won't be talking about in his State of the Union? He will surely not be apologizing for the many lies he told American voters: how he promised to defend the interests of working people, but then sold them out to Wall Street and the billionaire class."
"It was true in 1993 and it is true now: the time is long, long overdue for the United States to join the rest of the industrialized world and have a universal health care system."
Gov. Rosselló is right. We must immediately nullify Whitefish Energy’s outrageous $300 million contract.

The Republican tax plan is a massive transfer of wealth from working families to the top 1%. #CNNDebateNight
"For example, the average married couple making $75,000 with two children, a 3-yr-old and an 8-yr-old, will receive a total of $6,600 in the child tax credit, including 6 monthly payments of $550 and an additional $3,300 as part of their 2021 tax return."

"Right now, the people on top are doing phenomenally well while the working class of this country continues to struggle. That is not right. That MUST change."
I am on the Senate floor to say clearly: America's working class is in the worst financial shape since the Great Depression. We must fight for a COVID-19 package that provides real relief for working families.
The only thing the Senate should be doing right now is voting on a stimulus package to provide immediate economic relief to working class Americans— not ramming through a Supreme Court nominee who will strip health care from 20 million Americans in the middle of a pandemic.
We cannot just hope businesses will do the right thing.. . @realDonaldTrump: Support paid sick leave legislation for every worker in America.

Nearly 1 million refugees—nearly half of them children—are under threat as Syrian troops advance on Idlib..  . The United States must work urgently with the UN to achieve a ceasefire and ensure full access for humanitarian assistance.
Does Disney CEO Bob Iger have a good explanation for why he is being compensated more than $400 million while workers at Disneyland are homeless and relying on food stamps to feed their families?
This pandemic isn't over. We need to protect the workers fighting on the frontlines. I stand in solidarity with nurses and health care workers demanding that the Department of Labor retain emergency workplace protections and quickly issue a permanent standard.
"We spend $11,000 for every man, woman and child on health care—twice that of other rich countries.. . Yet 30 million are uninsured, thousands of health workers are losing jobs, and we lack basic medical equipment.. . It is time for a rational, single-payer, Medicare for All system."
"Our current system has forced people to pay for:. . $100,000 ambulance ride to the closest hospital. $540,000 kidney dialysis. $10,000 out-of-network doctor charge at an in-network hospital . . Medicare for All ends this insanity.. . Health care is a human right."
"Let us show the world today that the U.S. Senate recognizes that real American power does not come from our ability to blow things up, but from our ability to bring people together.. . We must finally end US support for the disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen."

"Johnson & Johnson will get a $12.9 billion tax break to ""create jobs."" Last time it repatriated offshore profits, the company fired people and gave executives a $32.8 million raise."
"Our most vulnerable communities are hungry, desperate and under enormous emotional stress. It is incomprehensible for Senator Mitch McConnell to tell us that he sees no urgency in passing another emergency relief bill and that he wants to wait another month before taking action."
Here's the economic reality under Trump:. . 29 million Americans don't have enough food. . 30 million unemployed workers lost $600 a week in benefits. . 40 million face eviction . . All while 467 billionaires made $800 billion in 5 months. . Our job: Create an economy that works for all
"Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was right when he said: “We must recognize that we can’t solve our problem now until there is a radical redistribution of economic and political power"" in America. Our society cannot sustain itself when so few have so much while so many have so little."
A three-letter word is blocking the Senate from passing common-sense gun legislation: the NRA.. . I wear the D- grade they gave me for my voting record as a badge of honor.
Unbelievable. Facial recognition technology identifies the wrong person 96% of the time according to Detroit's police chief.. . We must ban facial recognition technology for policing.
"Our government must work for ordinary Americans, not the top 1%. That should not be a radical idea."
"Trump on his tax cuts: ""It’s gonna be a tremendous thing for the American people. It’s gonna be fantastic for the economy."". . The reality: A windfall for massive corporations and billionaires. No major impact on job growth or investments in the US economy."
"As the latest war in Gaza was raging, I convened a small group of experts to discuss the situation and steps that must be taken to prevent future violence."
We live in a moment in history where we have more income and wealth inequality than any time since the 1920s. The idea that 60% of the benefits in the Republican tax plan go to the top 1% is beyond absurd. #TaxDebate
"You’re going to be hearing a lot about abortion in the news today. To my mind, this is not a complicated issue. Here’s why."

Now is the time for President Trump to stop his insulting tweets. Now is the time to rebuild Puerto Rico.
Fine—let’s call it “common sense.”
Republicans have used reconciliation for oil drilling in the arctic refuge and to pass trillions in tax breaks for the wealthy and the powerful by a simple majority vote. We can and we must do the same to raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour.

I’m live with @GovPhilScott now to talk about how we’re going to support Vermont’s students this summer after an incredibly difficult year.
"Instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, let us invest in education, pay every teacher at least $60,000, and create the best school system in the world..  . I want people to proudly say: ""I'm going to do one of the most important jobs in America: teaching our next generation."""

"The fairest way to reduce wealth inequality, invest in the disappearing middle class and preserve our democracy is to enact a progressive estate tax on the inherited wealth of multi-millionaires and billionaires.. . Today I'm introducing a bill to do that:"
The cost of college has increased astronomically in just one generation. This isn't sustainable. We need to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
"To nobody’s surprise the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, sided with big money interests and against the needs of working people. Make no mistake about it: this decision is a direct assault on working families all over America."
"This is an egregious attack on our democracy. The end of #NetNeutrality protections means that the internet will be for sale to the highest bidder. When our democratic institutions are already in peril, we must do everything we can to stop this decision from taking effect."
"We will not allow Donald Trump to:. . - Destroy 630,000 good-paying jobs. - Eliminate thousands of post offices. - Close hundreds of mail sorting plants. - Privatize and dismantle the Postal Service. . If we can bail out Boeing, we can save the Post Office."

@MittRomney I find Sen. Romney’s statement about needing to join the club with other foreign countries very curious. Here’s why:

"If not for Republicans' ""fiscally responsible"" policies, we would have run a $156 billion surplus this year."
The FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh must include a review of his numerous untruthful statements in his previous testimony before Congress. Lying to Congress is a federal crime. . . Here are his statements that appear to not be true: (1/x)
"Thank you @amazonnews for your response to our video. I remain deeply concerned about Amazon, an enormously profitable corporation, paying workers wages that are so low that they are forced to depend on federal programs like Medicaid, food stamps and public housing for survival."
"The result: the war in Vietnam cost us 59,000 American deaths and many others who came home wounded in body and spirit. In fact, a whole generation was devastated by that war. The casualties in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia are almost incalculable."
It is time for the owners of the nation’s most profitable corporations to pay their workers a living wage. That isn’t a radical idea in the richest country in the history of the world.
"For far too long Congress, under Democratic and Republican administrations, has abdicated its Constitutional role in authorizing war. That is the debate we are going to have today."
There is a metaphorical wildfire happening in our oceans that will devastate our planet’s marine ecosystems and coastal communities. We must immediately take aggressive action to address this global emergency before it is too late.

This morning I say to Senator McConnell: Please do not shut the government down. Sit down with the Democrats and start negotiating a compromise agreement.
The last thing the Senate should be doing right now is considering an extreme right-wing Supreme Court nominee who would strip health care benefits from over 20 million Americans and take away protections for preexisting conditions. No confirmation until after inauguration.

"Amazon made $10.8 billion in profits, didn't pay a dime in federal taxes, and got a $129 million check from the IRS—courtesy of Mitch McConnell and the Republican Senate.. . But as our people suffer, a $2,000 check to the working class is ""socialism for the rich""? Give me a break."
"Finally. Now, Trump must get Mitch McConnell and his Republican friends in the Senate to pass legislation to provide $2,000 in direct payments to the working class— legislation I introduced with @SenKamalaHarris and @SenMarkey 7 months ago."

"Six months after Trump and Republicans in Congress passed their tax plan, they are still lying about who it really helps. Here is what's really going on as a result of their scam:"
Wabtec provided some $60 million in payments to the company's 20 top executives as a result of its merger with GE but is now trying to force workers into 12 hour shifts without overtime pay. . . That is outrageous. I stand with UE Local 506 and 618.
"Right now we have the absurd situation where in the last year the five largest pharmaceutical companies in America made $50 billion in profits, while millions of Americans could not afford their medication. #MedicareForAll"
The job of Congress right now is to do everything we possibly can to protect Americans' lives and wellbeing—not hand out welfare checks to huge corporations.
"In the last 12 months, over 100,000 Americans died from drug overdose. That’s the most ever recorded in a single year and a 30% increase over last year. We are now living through a nationwide crisis of deaths of despair. Our people are in need, and their government must respond."
"Unbelievably, Congress right now wants to deregulate some of the same banks that helped cause the 2008 financial disaster. That is really unacceptable."
"I say to my Republican colleagues: The American people are catching on. While you may get away with this act of looting tonight, history is not on your side."
"In January, the child poverty rate increased by 40% in just 1 month – jumping from 12.1% to 17% as 3.7 million children slipped into poverty. How did this happen? 50 Republicans and 1 corporate Democrat allowed the $300 a month Child Tax Credit to expire. That is morally obscene."
Our fight against the Republican tax plan requires the same urgency as when they tried to repeal Obamacare. Health care for 13 million Americans is at stake.
"Our 640,000 postal workers are heroes, toiling under very difficult conditions to provide lifesaving services for the people of this country.. . Our job right now is to protect, expand and strengthen the Post Office. That means coming together to block Trump's privatization scheme."
I applaud my House colleagues for today’s historic passage of HJ Res 37 – ending U.S. support for the disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen. The Senate must quickly pass this resolution and finally reassert Congress' constitutional authority over war.
For the price of this single $13 billion warship—a total boondoggle—we could provide America's children universal school lunches for a full year.. . This is why we must confront the military-industrial complex and end the profiteering off of weapons of war.
"Ross Perot was a champion for veterans' rights and ahead of his time on disastrous trade policies. During his campaign, he explained, in depth, how he would address our national problems and spurred serious discussion. Ross Perot was a one-of-a kind American. He will be missed."
"The Saudi-led war in Yemen has been a humanitarian and strategic disaster. 85,000 children have starved to death. Today my colleagues and I are reintroducing our resolution to end U.S. support for this war and reclaim our constitutional authority."
Brett Kavanaugh was asked if the president has the power to pardon himself. He refused to answer.
"We looked into it, @realDonaldTrump. It’s called the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. You should check it out some time."
"Our job: Overturn Citizens United, move to the public funding of elections and create an economy and political system that works for all of us, not just the top 1 percent."
"Mr. President: Stop dividing the American people up by their religion, their race or their country of origin--and stop your ugly attacks against Muslim women in Congress. You are taking Rep. @RashidaTlaib's comments out of context and should apologize."
"After crashing the world economy and costing millions of Americans their jobs, Citigroup & Goldman Sachs took $3.7 trillion in taxpayer bailouts. Now, the GOP is giving them a $15.2 billion tax break."
"This is outrageous. President Trump’s proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan is a stark reminder that instead of worrying about the future of our planet, he is more concerned with protecting the interests of his friends in the fossil fuel industry."
"In real inflation accounted-for dollars, many workers today are not making a nickel more than they did 50 years ago. Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck.. . In the richest country in the history of the world, that is unacceptable."
"Juneteenth becoming a federal holiday is an important moment in understanding our country's history, and the horrors and lasting legacy of slavery. But real justice is when all Black Americans live free of oppression. That is not the work of a single day, but of every day."
"Trump's budget would take away nutrition assistance from more than 1 million pregnant women, infants and children by cutting the WIC program by $5.8 billion over the next decade. We must defeat this cruel budget."
"In my view, an asthma inhaler that is sold to the Canadian people for just $27 should not cost the American people $242. Period."
"Tonight, along with a great panel, I will discuss alternatives to the hawkish Washington foreign policy establishment that remains committed to never-ending military interventions. Tune in at 7PM ET."
"Congress must vote against this disastrous Pentagon authorization—a bill of astonishing moral cowardice. We do not need to shower Trump, his Saudi friends and the military-industrial complex with a $738-billion taxpayer giveaway."
"I want to congratulate and say thank you to the brave dining workers of the Senate and @UniteHere for forming your union and for saying that, when you work for the United States government, you’re going to have decent wages, decent benefits, and decent working conditions."
"Every single worker in this country has a right to a safe workplace where they will not be harassed, assaulted or punished for speaking up. We all must stand with the McDonald's workers who are bravely fighting back."
"We are dealing with a crisis of inequality and that is why we must start making the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes, not give breaks to those at the top. with @keithellison"
"This holiday weekend, let us reflect on the disturbing reality behind every plate of food—workers are being exploited and put at risk every day.. . They don’t need more lip service, they need justice: Hazard pay, sick leave, $15 an hour and a safe workplace."
"40 million people go hungry in America each year. Among children, in the richest country on Earth, how outrageous is it that 1 in 5 will go hungry this year? Yet Mr. Trump has proposed $22 billion in cuts to SNAP (food stamps)."
"We are dealing with a president who has not read or does not understand the Constitution.. . Today, the House and the Senate spelled it out for him: Mr. Trump, Congress will not allow you to start an illegal, immoral, and disastrous war against Iran."
"Today, I voted to convict President Trump on two articles of impeachment. It gives me no pleasure to conclude that he is guilty of the offenses laid out in the trial.. . Sadly, we have a president who sees himself as above the law and is ignorant or indifferent to the Constitution."
"In the richest country in the history of the world, poverty is a death sentence. We’re holding a hearing NOW on declining life expectancy for working Americans."
The Trump budget is morally bankrupt. It is nothing less than an attack on the poor and a major transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 1 percent.
"At a time when tens of millions of American workers are struggling economically, I will be going to the Senate floor at 4PM today to ask unanimous consent for my legislation to provide a direct payment of $1,200 for all working-class Americans and $500 for their children."
"How on earth can airlines—in the middle of pandemic—fly their planes at full capacity?. . I am demanding federal action to require social distancing, mask-wearing, and disinfection in planes and airports.. . We must put the safety of passengers and workers ahead of corporate profits."
"Once again, our critics are wrong: a new study found that in cities and states where wages went up, other low-wage workers got a bump in pay, and overall employment did not decrease. . . It's long past time for Congress to pass a $15-an-hour living wage."
"The 2nd, 3rd & 4th largest wildfires in California's history continue to rage. The sky on the West Coast turned red & orange. Please don't tell me the Green New Deal is radical. What's radical is having a president in office who rejects science and calls climate change a hoax."
"Two years ago, 17 students and faculty of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School were brutally killed.. . One year ago, the House passed HR 8 to require universal background checks for guns.. . 90% of Americans support this policy.. . Senator McConnell: Do your damn job. Pass this bill."
Here's why Democrats are standing up to Trump and Mitch McConnell:
We must pass disaster relief right now which treats Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands just as we will treat Texas and Florida. We cannot continue to delay given the enormous suffering there.
"This decision by the parole board is critically important. Rodney Reed's execution should not just be delayed, but canceled.. . Real criminal justice reform must include joining every other major democracy in eliminating the death penalty."
"For the second weekend in a row, thousands of brave Russians took to the streets to protest the corrupt rule of Putin and his thieving oligarchs. Unjustly imprisoned activists, including Alexei Navalny, must be released."
"While Vermont continues to lead the nation in syrup production, many studies are telling us that the climate crisis is threatening the industry.. . Now, more than ever, it’s important that we protect not only our planet, but also long-held and beloved practices, like sugaring."
"In the midst of a global pandemic, President Trump’s lawless deportation and detention regime continues to target the most vulnerable. We must invest in our immigrant communities, not pour more money into ICE, CBP, and private detention centers."
"Congress passed the largest unemployment benefits expansion in history, but families like the Rodriguezes are going hungry waiting for help to arrive.. . The federal government must assist every state and territory in America to get support out right away."
What is Trump afraid of? According to news reports President Trump himself has acknowledged that the release of the Nunes memo was designed to disrupt Robert Mueller’s investigation. No political stunt should interfere with the special counsel’s work.
"Justice for George Floyd, Adam Toledo, Daunte Wright and too many before them must include a national transformation that brings accountability for all officers who murder, including firings, criminal and civil penalties."
The great political issue now facing our country is not Democrat vs. Republican or progressive vs. conservative. It's much deeper than that. It's about democracy vs. authoritarianism.
"At a time of massive inequality, the Republican tax bill will unbelievably provide 83% of the benefits to the top 1%, while increasing taxes on 92 million middle-class households by the end of the decade."
"If we could bail out Wall Street and give $1.5 trillion in tax breaks to private corporations, we damn well can cancel all student debt in this country—no exceptions."
"We are finally addressing the issue of sexual harassment, and we need to get it right. But the conversation we are having now is only the tip of the iceberg."
"We saved a seat for the CEOs of American Airlines, Disney, Amazon, Walmart and McDonald’s in case they have the courage to face their workers. Tune in at 7 pm ET on Facebook to see if they’ll show up."
"Billionaires like Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Trump may not get it, but It's not complicated. Federal employees go to food banks because they have to feed their kids, and they can't do that without a paycheck. Mr. President. End the shutdown you created."
"Why does America pay 1,000% more for the exact same prescription drugs as the rest of the world?. . It might be for the same reason our top pharmaceutical CEOs make $50 million a year."
Mr. President. Stop holding federal employees hostage and stop holding the young people in DACA hostage. End the federal shutdown and reinstate legal status for these young Americans. #NoWall
"Thank you to the students from Parkland, Florida, who are doing everything they can to prevent another mass shooting like they experienced. These really are incredibly bright young people. Because of them, I think it's possible we are going to see real change."
"When we say it's time to provide health care to all our people, we're told we can't afford it.. . But if the stock market is in trouble, no problem! The government can just hand out $1.5 trillion to calm bankers on Wall Street."
"If @SenTedCruz doesn't come through for the Koch brothers on these tax cuts, he's going to be in trouble."
"A huge fire in Siberia is casting smoke for 3,000 miles. . . Greece: burning. . . California: burning. . . Oregon: burning. . . July 2021 was the hottest month ever recorded. . . We must combat climate change now."
"Jane and I are deeply saddened by the loss of our good friend, Rep. Elijah Cummings. I was honored to work closely with him over the years. His integrity and moral vision for his community and the country were extraordinary."
John Bolton really has chutzpah. First Bolton urges George W. Bush to invade Iraq and now he is moving our country closer to conflict with Iran. We are on a very dangerous path.
Trump's own top security officials say Iran is meeting its commitments under the deal and that it is in the security interests of the US.
Republicans had no problem giving a $1.4 billion tax break to the Koch family worth $128 billion. But they just can't stand that an unemployed worker who lost a job during a pandemic is receiving an extra $300 a week in benefits to help pay the rent. Total hypocrisy!
"Donald Trump is in Pennsylvania to tell truck drivers how his tax plan will benefit them. Unfortunately, once again, the president is lying."
How pathetic. Endless wars all across the planet aren't enough for the neocons. Now they want to deploy U.S. soldiers against Americans exercising their First Amendment right at home. No. We cannot let them trample over the Constitution or harm our fellow Americans.
"This major settlement will benefit the people of Vermont, who have been hurt and misled by opioid distributors like Reckitt. I am proud of our state’s Attorney General for taking the fight to the pharmaceutical industry, and winning."
Today is #NationalDoctorsDay. Men and women in the medical profession are literally putting their lives on the line to protect the American people. . . We have an immense amount of gratitude. You are the heroes and heroines of our country today. Thank you.
"At a time when voting rights are under grave attack, there is absolutely no place on the federal bench for Thomas Farr, who both authored and defended tactics designed to suppress minority voters. I strongly oppose his nomination."
"Credit card interest rates are absurdly high—the median credit card interest rate is an outrageous 21 percent.. . Working together, we will end the greed of Wall Street banks ripping off the American people. My legislation with @AOC puts a common-sense cap on interest rates."
Trump's cruelty and xenophobia never stops: ICE wants to send women and moms back to a for-profit detention center where there is a pattern of suicide and abuse. I support the efforts of @RAICESTEXAS and other organizers to prevent this from happening.
"Let me congratulate the Starbucks workers in Boston who won their 64-day strike for fair schedules and decent working conditions. When workers stand together and fight for justice, there is nothing they cannot accomplish. I was proud to have stood on the picket line with them."
Congratulations to UE Locals 506 and 618 for their successful effort in standing up for justice and dignity. . . This is a victory for workers across the country who are sick and tired of seeing their standard of living decline as a result of corporate greed.
"“Call it democracy, or call it democratic socialism, but there must be a better distribution of wealth within this country for all of God's children.” — Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr."
Tax the wealthy. Address the long-neglected crises of the working class. NOW.
Why would any member of Congress vote to move us closer to another taxpayer bailout of large financial institutions?
I don't know why President Trump and Republicans want to shut down the government over a wall no one wants and an unprecedented $100 billion increase in military spending. What the American people want is to protect Dreamers and working families.
Getting sick shouldn't mean you go bankrupt. But that is the reality for far too many Americans. Is that the case for you and your family?
"Obviously, as soon as we can, we must end the filibuster that currently exists in the U.S. Senate. Given the enormous crises facing working families today, we cannot allow a minority of the Senate to obstruct what the vast majority of the American people want and need."
"Trump’s haphazard and reckless plan to impose tariffs on Canada and the European Union is an absolute disaster that will cause unnecessary economic pain to farmers, manufacturers and consumers in Vermont and around the country."
We are not living in a poor nation. We are living in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world. How do we have one of the highest rates of childhood poverty of any major country? How could it be that we don't guarantee health care to all people? We must demand change.
Medicare must negotiate drug prices and we must substantially lower drug prices for all Americans through the budget reconciliation process.
"Instead of giving huge tax breaks to corporations who shut down in the United States and send jobs abroad to low-wage countries, we must invest in creating worker-owned companies."
"The pharmaceutical industry doesn’t want us to lower the cost of prescription drugs. The fossil fuel industry wants to continue making profits off of destroying the planet. . . We must show the American people that government represents them, not powerful interest groups."
We are looking today at doctors and nurses who can't acquire the masks they need as they put their lives on the line.. . Yet we are the wealthiest country in the history of the world.. . How does that happen?
"Today the Inflation Reduction Act passed the Senate 51-50. In my view, this legislation goes nowhere near far enough for working families, but it does begin to address the existential crisis of climate change. It’s an important step forward and I was happy to support it."
"Unemployment:. 🇺🇸14.7%. 🇩🇰4.9%. . McDonald's hourly wage:. 🇺🇸$9. 🇩🇰$22. . Weeks of paid vacation:. 🇺🇸0. 🇩🇰5. . COVID19 deaths per million:. 🇺🇸231. 🇩🇰87. . COVID19 tests per 1,000:. 🇺🇸24. 🇩🇰49. . Maybe Americans deserve the same safety and dignity that Denmark's people enjoy."
"The Trump administration is focused on making it harder for homeless trans people to get safe shelter during this pandemic. That is outrageous.. . As a society, we can—and we must—end homelessness and housing discrimination against trans people."
"Cost for one vial of insulin in 1996: $21 . Cost for one vial of insulin in 2018: $320.  . Does anyone really think that makes any sense? No, it’s barbaric."
"We need a secretary of state who will stand up for people of all faiths, sexual orientations and genders, not someone like Pompeo who opposes women’s rights and LGBTQ rights and who promotes religious bigotry."
Let us have the courage to stand together and fight back against corporate greed. Let us fight back against massive income and wealth inequality. Let us fight back against a corrupt political system.
"The dangerous Line 3 pipeline in Minnesota would send a million barrels of tar sands oil—the dirtiest fossil fuel in the world—through the headwaters of the Mississippi River, tribal treaty lands and sacred wild rice beds. It must be stopped. #StopLine3"
"This is what Christmas season looks like in Trumpland:. -Take away paychecks of 800,000 workers by shutting the government.. -Take away $1.40 meals from 755,000 hungry, unemployed Americans.. - Give Pfizer a $26.5 billion tax cut after it increased the price of life saving drugs."
"Bad news for those who say our seniors' benefits are too ""extravagant"": We're expanding them.. . My Social Security Expansion Act provides low-income seniors $1,300 more a year by making millionaires and billionaires pay their share of Social Security taxes."
LIVE: We recently found out a terrible truth about the rapid movement toward global oligarchy. #ParadisePapers
"9 years ago the disastrous Citizens United decision opened the door for billionaires and corporate interests to buy our elections.. . To restore our one person, one vote democracy, we must pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United and stop the slide to oligarchy."
"Clearly, Jeff Bezos, the second wealthiest person on the planet, desperately needs $10 billion from the American taxpayer to go to the moon. After all, he is only worth $150 billion."
"Here are 6 of the 10 fastest-growing jobs in America:.  . • Personal care aide—$24,020. • Food preparer—$21,250. • Home health aide—$24,200. • Cook—$26,530. • Waiter—$21,780. • Janitor—$26,110. . If we want a decent, humane society, workers must get at least $15 an hour and a union."
"When I was a kid growing up in Brooklyn, I obsessively followed the Brooklyn Dodgers. As mayor of Burlington, I helped bring minor league baseball back to the city. Today's team is the @VTLakeMonsters and I had the honor of throwing out the first pitch on opening day this year."
"At a time when climate change threatens our planet, when our infrastructure is crumbling, when 30 million people have no health insurance, I'm concerned that the concept of PAYGO will make it harder for Congress to address the many crises facing our working families."
"A 10% cut to the Pentagon could provide high-quality childcare to every family in America, regardless of income.. . It's time to put #PeopleOverPentagon. I will be on the Senate floor today at 11:20 AM to fight for our amendment to defund the Pentagon and invest in our people."
"Why are we the only advanced country with no guaranteed family leave, sick days or vacations? Because corporate America hates unions..  . Our plan, the Workplace Democracy Act, will revitalize union organizing so America's working class has a dignified life."
"Millions of people are hurting. They are struggling to put food on the table for their kids. Meanwhile, the rich are better off than they have ever been. That is the economic reality facing this country right now."
"We’ve taken the first step in addressing the emergency situation facing working families. Now we’ve got to deal with our long-term structural problems. . . I hope Republicans join us, but if they don’t we must use our majority to get it done."
"Amazingly, we have a president who is trying to destroy the American health care system."
"Joe Biden will be President at noon on January 20. Republican attempts to overturn the election only demonstrate their disdain for voters, democracy and the will of the American people."
I agree with Senator Cruz. Congress already blocked weapons sales to the authoritarian regime of Saudi Arabia. . . Mr. President: follow the damn law.
We have led the world in so many ways for so long. But we can't continue to be the only major nation where health care isn't a right.
"Opioid makers flooded America with 100 billion pills from 2006-2014.. . 130,000 people died due to their greed.. . Executives lied about opioids’ addictiveness, pocketing billions in profits.. . My Opioid Crisis Accountability and Results Act helps put corporate criminals behind bars."
"These incredible high schoolers are working to stop the unconstitutional U.S.-Saudi war in Yemen. They know Congress has the power of the purse. A new effort by @RepRoKhanna, @RepAdamSchiff, @RepAdamSmith and @RepJayapal will defund Trump's participation in this brutal conflict."
Do we think American democracy is about a couple of wealthy billionaires putting hundreds of millions of dollars into campaigns without disclosure?. . Is that the democracy Americans fought and died for in war after war?. . I think not.
"Congress must listen to the 650+ environmental and civil rights organizations who wrote that it would be ""morally abhorrent"" to attach Sen. Manchin’s fossil fuel ""side deal"" to the Continuing Resolution or any other must pass bill."
My thoughts are with the families and friends of the victims and all those wounded in the horrific shooting in Las Vegas.
"We’ve seen this movie before. It was a bad movie. The last time Congress enacted a corporate tax holiday on overseas profits in 2004, the top 15 beneficiaries cut 21,000 U.S. jobs."
What would it mean for your family if health care was guaranteed to all as a right? #MedicareForAll
We won't have a moral or sustainable economy when so few have so much and so many have so little. It's unacceptable that the 50 richest people in the U.S. own more wealth than the bottom half—160 million. In the richest country on Earth let's create an economy that works for all.
We live in the richest country on earth.. . School lunch debt should not exist. . Student loan debt should not exist.. Medical debt should not exist.
"Kavanaugh repeatedly told the committee he never drank to the point where he didn’t remember something. He also denied ever becoming aggressive when he drinks. There have been many reports from Kavanaugh's high school, college and law school classmates that contradict this. (7/x)"
"I applaud the House of Representatives for voting to end all U.S. participation in the disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen. Congress has the power to end this brutal, unconstitutional military intervention. I will do everything in my power in the Senate to see that it becomes law."
"Trump promised he was going to provide ""health insurance to everybody."". . But every single year he has been president the number of uninsured children in America has gone up. Now he's attempting to throw 20 million Americans off health insurance in the midst of a pandemic. SAD!"
"Remember when Donald Trump tweeted that he was ""trying to end the endless wars?"" That was yesterday. . . Today he's sending thousands of troops, warplanes, and missiles to his dictator friends in Saudi Arabia to escalate military tensions with Iran."
Trump's budget is breathtaking in its cruelty. It cuts:. . - $1.5 trillion from Medicaid. - $845 billion from Medicare. - $25 billion from Social Security. . This budget does the exact opposite of what Trump promised the American people.
"I welcome these remarks from Secretary-Designate Blinken.. . Congress must work in a bipartisan way with the new administration to finally end the horrific war in Yemen, and ensure that no president can ever again engage in unconstitutional wars."
"Nearly half a century ago, the Supreme Court affirmed abortion as a constitutional right. This Supreme Court's refusal to overturn Texas’ law banning abortion is outrageous. Women get to control their bodies, not politicians and not judges."
"The Founding Fathers gave the power to authorize military conflicts to Congress, the branch most accountable to the people. For far too long Congress, under Democratic and Republican administrations, has abdicated its Constitutional role in authorizing war."
"I strongly oppose lowering income eligibility for direct payments from $75,000 to $50,000 for individuals and $150,000 to $100,000 for couples. In these difficult times, ALL working class people deserve the full $1,400. Last I heard, someone making $55,000 a year is not ""rich."""

"Workers earning $7.25 an hour must work an extra 41 days just to make the same amount they did in 2009, the last time Congress raised the federal minimum wage. It is way past time we take action and pay workers a living wage of $15 an hour."
"Today, the Senate will vote on overriding Trump's veto of our bipartisan bill to end unlawful U.S. participation in the Saudi-led war in Yemen. This is not about partisan politics. What’s at stake are millions of innocent lives and our Constitution. I urge my colleagues vote yes."
"One of the great crises facing our democracy is the power of the billionaire class over our political process. Congress must have the courage to take them on and fight for their constituents, not their billionaire campaign contributors."
People 65 and older must have pretty good health insurance 🤔
"Companies today know every aspect of a person’s life—where they go, what they do, their medical and financial records, whom they talk to, what they buy—and use that information to make billions in profit."
"In 2007 and 2011, Jeff Bezos, the wealthiest man alive, paid nothing in federal income taxes.. . In 2018, Elon Musk, the 2nd wealthiest person in America, paid nothing in federal income taxes.. . Yes. At a time of massive wealth and income inequality, we must tax the rich."

Join me and @CoryBooker as we talk about ending the federal prohibition on marijuana.
"150,000 coronavirus deaths.. 30 million without an unemployment lifeline.. 5 million newly uninsured.. 14 million children going hungry..  . But Trump is too busy playing golf and boasting about the stock market. Obscene."
"Inflation Rate. 🇪🇺: 10.9%. 🇩🇪: 10.9%. 🇬🇧: 10.1%. 🇮🇹: 9.4%. 🇪🇸: 9%. 🇮🇪: 8.6%. 🇺🇸: 8.2%. . No. Inflation is not going up in the U.S. because the working class got a $1,400 check 19 months ago. Multinational corporations are jacking up prices worldwide."
"The Walton family is America's wealthiest family. Net worth: $201 billion.. . Walmart pay their workers starvation wages. Many are forced to go on Medicaid, food stamps, and public housing. Who pays for that? The middle class.. . That is what corporate welfare is all about."
"Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez have risked their lives to come forward and tell their stories. Republican Senators, their staff and the Trump administration must stop disparaging these brave women and treat them with respect."
"As profitable corporations like Walmart rake in billions in Black Friday sales, it’s time for their workers to receive the hazard pay, a safe workplace, paid sick leave, a living wage and the benefits they deserve."
"Today, we honor George Floyd’s life and mourn with his family. One year after his murder, we remain dedicated to rooting out systemic racism and police violence against people of color, and building a nation free of oppression that respects the human dignity of every person."

"Today, our younger generations have a lower standard of living than their parents did at their age. . . Meanwhile, the cost of housing is 72% higher and the cost of college is 163% higher than it was 20 years ago – after adjusting for inflation..  . The time for action is NOW."
"While Jeff Bezos' wealth has increased $260 million every single day this year, he continues to pay many Amazon employees wages so low that they're forced to depend on taxpayer-funded programs such as food stamps, Medicaid and public housing to survive."
For the last 18 years @GunnelsWarren has been by my side watching Republicans try to destroy the middle class.
Climate change is an existential disaster facing the entire world. We must transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. A Green New Deal can save the planet and create millions of new jobs.
"I hope that Trump will submit a new nominee who has the experience necessary to run the agency, who sides with every major veterans’ organization in vigorously opposing VA privatization and who will work to quickly fill the vacancies so our veterans get the care they deserve."
"It’s outrageous that in the middle of a deadly pandemic the eviction moratorium has ended. I’m proud to stand with @RepCori, @AOC and so many demanding the government respond to the needs of working people and extend it. We cannot allow people to be thrown onto the streets."
"Our grassroots movement got Democrats and Republicans to pass our bill to end the U.S. role in Saudi Arabia's brutal war in Yemen. . . Although Trump vetoed it, Congress can still rein in this president and put an end to the world's worst humanitarian crisis."

I am going down to the Senate floor to vote AGAINST the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett.. . We should not be voting on a Supreme Court justice—we should be voting on major COVID19 relief to protect working families.. . We will make this the top priority of a Democratic Senate.
It is an outrage that debt collectors are garnishing wages and Social Security checks for unpaid medical bills and student loans.. . We must cancel all medical and student debt—and stop all debt collection right now.. . A pandemic is not a time for greed.
"The Arizona Supreme Court recently took away in-state tuition for DACA students, so young people like Fernando are struggling to figure out how to stay in school. This should not be happening in the United States of America."
"No matter how badly Trump wants to use the coronavirus pandemic to give handouts to the coal, oil and gas industries, they simply can't compete with renewables. We should be bailing out the working families of this country, not the wealthy oil and coal companies."
"The big banks don't want us to cancel all $1.7 trillion in student debt by taxing Wall Street speculation.. . Too bad. It will be a tremendous act of economic, racial, and social justice for working people."
"Greed. Greed. Greed. While Americans are struggling at the pump, in the first three months of this year, 21 oil and gas companies made over $41 billion in profits, more than double their profits from last year. The problem is not inflation. The problem is corporate greed."
"How sick is Trump's revolving door? The current head of the EPA protecting our air is Andrew Wheeler, an ex-coal lobbyist. Before him, Scott Pruitt ignored his own scientists to make Wisconsin breathe in more smog. Now he works for the coal industry, too."
"For the last 48 years real wages for the working class in this country have been stagnant while the very rich have gotten much richer. Today, the top 1% own more wealth than the bottom 92%. Our job is to defeat oligarchy and create an economy that works for all, not just the few."
"I have long believed that marijuana should be legalized and those arrested for possession should be pardoned and have their records expunged. The President’s executive action today is an important step forward, but much more needs to be done."
"Secretary Pompeo, I hate to break it to you, but plunging the world in to a full-scale climate catastrophe is nothing to be proud of."
"Sears wants to give its executives $25 million in bonuses after closing over 100 stores and laying off thousands of employees. My friends, this is what a rigged economy is all about. (with @riseupretail)"
"Congratulations to the over 6,000 Amazon employees who are demanding their employer address the global crisis of climate change. This letter is a step in the right direction. We must come together to ensure we leave a habitable planet for our kids and grandchildren."
The FCC just voted to repeal #NetNeutrality. We must do everything we can to stop this egregious decision from taking effect.
"The average household with credit card debt owes over $15,000. . . The average interest rate on these cards? Above 17%..  . Soon, I’ll introduce legislation to put a stop to this. How have steep interest rates and fees impacted you? Please share your story."
"This Russian father is right. Putin and his oligarchs started this horrific war but, as is always the case, it's not their kids who will fight it."
A major challenge that our rural communities face today is the struggle to staff our volunteer fire departments and EMS crews. I am enormously proud of young people like Danielle who feel called to serve and who are stepping up to help keep their communities safe.
"Over and over again, Donald Trump tells us the U.S. economy is “absolutely booming.” Then why have wages gone down, not up, by 5 cents an hour since June of last year after adjusting for inflation?"
I have something to say to Mr. Trump: Tell your Republican friends in the Senate you'll veto this disastrous budget.
"I'm proud to stand in solidarity with the 1,700 locomotive manufacturing workers in Erie, Pennsylvania, who are fighting to keep the pay and benefits they have won as members of the UE union. . . Corporate executives must not use the merger between GE and Wabtec to hurt workers."
"Over 50 killed in Gaza today and 2,000 wounded, on top of the 41 killed and more than 9,000 wounded over the past weeks. This is a staggering toll. Hamas violence does not justify Israel firing on unarmed protesters."
You want to restore people’s faith in democracy? Have a government that works for them.
"It needs to be an ongoing movement of women and men that includes a national discussion about sexism, sexual harassment, objectification, inequality and abuse of power."
"Nearly 3,000 people died. . . That is not a “success.” That is a tragedy and a disgrace."
"I applaud New Hampshire for becoming the 21st state to abolish the death penalty. Too many innocent people, particularly racial minorities, get caught up in this unjust policy. A civilized society shouldn’t be involved in the murder of other Americans."
It is particularly obscene for Trump to repeal the estate tax which would provide a $269 billion tax break to the top 0.2%.
"We spend $700 billion a year on the military and have been at war in Afghanistan for 17 years and Iraq for 15. The time is long overdue for a vigorous discussion about our foreign policy, and how it needs to change in this new era. #SandersSAIS"
"Yesterday Trump’s nominee to lead the EPA, Andrew Wheeler, wouldn't call climate change a crisis. And in his opening statement, he didn’t mention the words ""climate change"" once.. . We need an administration that leads the world in combatting climate change, not denies this crisis."
"So far as a result of the Saudi-led war in Yemen:. -Over 10,000 civilians have been killed. -Over 3 million have been displaced. -15 million people lack access to clean water and sanitation. -More than 1 million cases of cholera have been reported"
"""Do you know what it's like to not have food for your children?"" Listen to these two single mothers tell their stories about struggling every day just to survive in this economy."
"Some argue that the U.S. is not really engaged in hostilities in Yemen. But when Yemenis see ""Made in USA"" on the bombs killing their children, it’s very clear that the United States is part of this horrible war. This must end."
"I congratulate @NationalNurses on this major achievement! This is what we can do when workers—facing unacceptable violence at their jobs—come together, organize, and engage in the political process. Now we must pass this legislation in the Senate without delay."
"The Republican tax bill is a hole-in-one for Trump himself, who will benefit from tax breaks for real estate investors and golf course owners. This is a disgrace."
"There it is! My Republican friend from Pennsylvania finally admitted it last night. After the tax bill passes, they are going to come back to cut your Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. They must be defeated."
We shouldn't throw 13 million people off of health insurance to give more money to billionaires and corporations. I can't believe we even have to say that.
"Today, @NydiaVelazquez and I introduce legislation to say: Millions are going hungry during this pandemic. The people of Puerto Rico must receive same help from the federal government as any state—period."
".@RepPressley, @SenWarren and I call on Congress to act quickly to provide our country's Community Health Centers with the $77 billion in funding they need. CHCs are vital and irreplaceable, now more than ever."
"Trump's executive order does nothing to ensure the 2,400 kids who have been torn from their parents will be reunited with their families."
The Republican tax bill would be a major step forward in creating the kind of oligarchy long envisioned by the Koch brothers and other powerful right wing extremists.
"Republicans in Congress want to spend this last week before the government funding deadline trying to pass tax breaks for the rich. What if, instead, we actually addressed the crises affecting working people?"
"If we're serious about reducing income inequality and rebuilding the middle class, we must increase the number of union jobs in this country."
"If you missed Bernie's response to Trump's State of the Union last night, watch here now:"
We must end U.S. support for the disastrous war in Yemen and reassert Congressional oversight.
"As the planet becomes warmer, as unprecedented fires, drought, floods, and extreme weather disturbances cause mass destruction, and when scientists tell us that we only have a few years to avoid irreparable damage to our planet, are we really going to ignore this global crisis?"
"Remdesivir costs less than $10 to manufacture. @GileadSciences is charging $3,100 for it..  . Taxpayers spent $70 million to develop this drug. Coronavirus has killed 130,000 Americans. It's time to take control of this patent and provide remdesivir to all who need it."
"Given the enormous economic desperation facing working families in this country today, I will not be able to support the recently announced Manchin-Romney COVID19 proposal unless it is significantly improved.. . Read my full statement:"
"As we come toward the end of 2017, I hope and expect that most Americans know that almost every promise that @realDonaldTrump made during his presidential campaign was a lie. Just a few examples:"
LIVE NOW: What does it really mean to have a progressive government? @NYCMayor is here with me to talk it over.
The American people want to see Congress take on the big money special interests and address the crises facing working families today. Let’s get it done.
The Trump tax scam was a fraud from the start and Republicans are now paying the price.
I congratulate Spain's government for declaring a climate emergency. The United States must now follow suit. . . My resolution with @AOC and @RepBlumenauer mobilizes America to defeat the existential threat facing humanity.
"Donald Trump led the effort to throw 32 million Americans off of health care and proposed massive cuts to Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security, so it should come as no surprise that he is opposed to our effort to guarantee health care for all Americans."
"Trump talked about DACA and immigration, but what he did not tell the American people is that he precipitated this crisis in September by repealing President Obama’s executive order protecting Dreamers. #BernieResponds"
Millions depends on Medicaid for opioid treatment. Trump's solution is to cut Medicaid by $1 trillion. That is a disgrace.
"Instead of wasting billions on a wall with Mexico, tax breaks for billionaires and a bloated military budget, we need to end childhood poverty, rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, combat climate change and invest in our kids and seniors."
The brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents demands that we make clear that United States support for Saudi Arabia is not unconditional. It’s time to stop the war in Yemen.
"As a result of Trump's shutdown, 800,000 federal employees are in danger of not receiving a paycheck.. . They're worried about how they'll pay their mortgages, feed their families and put gas in their cars.. . Unbelievably, Republican leader Mitch McConnell refuses to take action."
I want to applaud @RepJoeNeguse for this passionate defense of country's immigrants and Dreamers—kids who are American in every way but a piece of paper.
"Target’s announcement today shows us that a $15 minimum wage is an idea whose time has come. Years of grassroots organizing has created an unstoppable movement. Now the Senate must pass our Raise the Wage Act and guarantee a dignified, living wage for every worker in America."
Think of how broken our economic system is. A warehouse worker whose bathroom break goes too long gets threatened with being fired. . . A typical consequence for a CEO who runs a corporation to the ground? Millions of more dollars in salary and bonuses.
"Yesterday's mass execution underscores how urgent it has become for the United States to redefine our relationship with the despotic regime in Saudi Arabia, and to show that the Saudis do not have a blank check to continue violating human rights and dictating our foreign policy."
Access to affordable home energy is not a luxury. It is a matter of life and death. No American should go cold in the wintertime. Trump must fund the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program at no less than $5.1 billion in his upcoming budget.
"A moral society does not give tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations, and then cut back support for struggling seniors or people with disabilities."
"There's been endless stories about the role of the president, the conflicts in the House and Senate, the opposition of two senators, the size of the bill, etc. – but very limited coverage of what the provisions of the bill are and the crises for working people that they address."
Senator Manchin has been critical of the $3.5 trillion proposal that many of us support. But the time is long overdue for him to tell us with specificity what he wants and does not want and explain that to the American people.
This is cronyism at its worst: A Postmaster General who has no experience delivering mail—just huge campaign contributions to Trump.. . We cannot let this president exploit a horrific pandemic to privatize the Postal Service or bust postal workers' unions.
"Shock. Shock. Shock. Gas prices are at the highest level in 7 years while Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell & BP made nearly $25 billion in profits last quarter – the highest level in over 7 years. The problem is not inflation. The problem is corporate greed, collusion & profiteering."
"It is tragic but unsurprising that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny will be sent to prison for 9 years. Putin’s authoritarian regime cannot tolerate dissent, especially from someone who exposes the enormous wealth Putin and his cronies have stolen from the Russian people."
Farmworkers often go unrecognized for their vital contributions to bringing food to our tables. But they are vulnerable to abuse and many have been forced to work in modern-day slavery. The exploitation of farmworkers has no place in a civilized society.
"Why will our agenda—living wages, a healthy planet, peace, health care, education and housing for all—succeed?. . Because that is the agenda of the working class. The majority.. . And when working people come together and fight for it, big-money interests don’t stand a chance."
The stock prices of massive pharmaceutical companies tumbled because we are pushing to make health care a human right for every American. Corporate greed has no place in health care.
Yes. It is time for the wealthy and large corporations to pay their fair share of taxes.
"I am very concerned by last night’s strike by U.S. forces in Syria. The president has the responsibility to keep Americans safe, but for too long administrations of both parties have interpreted their authorities in an extremely expansive way to continue war. This must end."
Jeff Bezos' income per day: $215 million. Federal taxes Amazon pays: $0. Amazon's spending to buy Seattle's City Council: $1.6 million. . The only way we take back our democracy and end this obscene system of oligarchy is by standing up and fighting back.
"I’ve heard Senator Manchin talk about not wanting to see our country become ‘an entitlement society.’ Well, I’m not exactly sure what that means."
"We need a new member of the Supreme Court who has a strong track record standing up for justice – economic justice, racial justice, social justice, political justice and environmental justice. There is no doubt that Judge Jackson is that person. I strongly support her nomination."
Join me tonight at 10:45 PM ET on Facebook Live for my response to President Trump's State of the Union address. I can promise you I’ll have a lot to say.
"85,000 children have already starved to death as a result of the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen.. . Millions more face the prospect of famine and death.. . The U.S. should be doing everything we can to support the ceasefire, not undermining it. Disgusting!"
"What a hypocrite! Given the choice between hiring American workers at a living wage or hiring much less expensive workers from China that he can exploit, Donald Trump opts for the low-wage overseas labor day in and day out."
"If Sen. Manchin wants to vote against the Build Back Better Act, he should have the opportunity to do so with a floor vote as soon as the Senate returns."
"It is obvious that the President is a pathological liar who does not understand the Constitution. The fact is that if Mr. Trump continues to disregard the right of Congress to subpoena, he will leave House Members with no choice but to begin an impeachment inquiry."
Racist and sexist behavior on the part of those who wear a uniform of the United States is unacceptable. The DHS must investigate and take strong action against those found guilty of this vulgar behavior.
"""You say you love your children above all else, yet you are stealing their futures right before their very eyes,"" - This 15-year-old activist @GretaThunberg just called out world leaders for their global inaction on climate change."
"American taxpayers are already funding the development of a coronavirus vaccine. When it is ready, we must put it in the public domain and ensure that it's available to all.. . No more privatizing, monopolizing and profiteering by Big Pharma."
"The American Rescue Plan showed what good and moral policy can do. For example, it helped reduce childhood poverty in the US by 50%..  . But it would be a shame to stop there. Let’s pass the reconciliation bill. Let’s transform our economy to work for the many, not just the few."
I am LIVE in the Senate to oppose a $740 billion military budget without being able to vote on amendments.. . The American people deserve a real debate before we build more bombs instead of schools.
Today's modern-day loan sharks are no longer lurking on street corners—they wear Armani suits and work on Wall Street..  . @RepAOC and I have a “radical” idea: no bank in America should charge an interest rate higher than 15%.
"A worker today earning the federal minimum wage makes $1,257 a month.. The median rent for an apartment today is $1,362 a month.. . Addressing the needs of the American people is not radical. What’s radical is doing nothing while families struggle."
"If you want to know why the American people have so much contempt for what goes on in Congress it is because time after time after time, the Republican leadership in Congress is doing the exact opposite of what the American people want."
"No, Secretary Zinke. The record-breaking wildfires in California have everything to do with climate change. We must confront the reality that climate change is already destroying tens of thousands of lives, and take concrete steps to avoid its worst consequences."
President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal is the latest in a series of reckless decisions that move our country closer to conflict.
I frankly do not understand why Republicans seem to hate providing health care to the American people.
"Last year, 3 of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in America – Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and AbbVie – increased their profits by 90 percent to $54 billion – while half of the new brand name drugs now cost over $180,000. Obscene."
Fatal shootings by police in 2018:. . 🇮🇸-0. 🇫🇮-3. 🇸🇪-6. 🇫🇷-26. 🇨🇦-36. 🇺🇸-992. . Imagine: Walter Scott—and so many others—would be alive today if we had the major criminal justice reform we need in this country.
"Patriotic millionaires like Abigail Disney are right. By any objective measure, a CEO-to-worker pay ratio over a thousand is insane."
"Let’s be honest and acknowledge that we are seeing a rapid movement toward a political system in which a handful of very wealthy people and special interests determine who gets elected or who does not..  . That is not, to say the least, what this country is supposed to be about."
"Over and over again, Republicans say we cannot possibly afford to make health care a right through a Medicare-for-all program.. . But when it comes to spending $716 billion on the military, all of a sudden there's deafening silence from my Republican colleagues about the deficit."
"The Koch brothers and other right-wing groups are trying to destroy unions in America, and that's exactly what the Janus Supreme Court case is about."
"Disney CEO Bob Iger's pay: $65.6 million. Disney workers: Living out of their cars. . When we consider this grotesque inequality in wealth and power, ultimately we are asking a moral question: What kind of nation will we be?"
"Healthcare spending per capita:. . 🇺🇸 $11,702 - 92 million uninsured/under-insured. 🇩🇪 $6,646 - 0 uninsured. 🇨🇦$5,418 - 0 uninsured. 🇫🇷 $5,376 - 0 uninsured. 🇯🇵 $4,823 - 0 uninsured. 🇬🇧 $4,653 - 0 uninsured. 🇫🇮$4,578 - 0 uninsured. 🇰🇷 $3,384 - 0 uninsured. . Yes. #MedicareForAll saves money"
"Trump is shutting down the government not just for his absurd wall. When you don't pay 800,000 federal workers you are destroying the concept of government in a democratic society, and moving to more privatization and corporate control over our lives."
"The president made clear today that he will not keep the promises he made during the campaign to lower the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs. Instead, he has become a supporter of the pharmaceutical industry's extraordinary greed."
"The choice is simple: Will we stand with the working class to guarantee paid family leave, expand Medicare, and address the climate crisis, or will Congress, yet again, do the bidding of powerful special interests? I choose to stand with the working class."
We must vigorously support diplomatic efforts to deescalate this crisis and reaffirm Ukrainian independence and sovereignty. I’m LIVE on the Senate floor explaining why.
How can it be that millions of people live in poverty while working full time in the world’s richest country for the world’s richest companies? How can we tolerate this? . . The answer is clear: pay every worker at least $15 an hour and let them unionize.
"Over the past 40 years there has been an enormous transfer of income from the middle class to rich. Since 1979, the bottom 90% of Americans have seen their share of national income decline from 58% to just 46%—costing them nearly $11,000 per household."
"If you paid $20 to mail a Federal Express package overnight, you paid more to Federal Express than it paid in federal income taxes over the past 3 years after making over $8.2 billion in profits. Yes, we are going to demand that companies like FedEx pay their fair share of taxes."
"The women of this country have the right to control their own bodies, not politicians. . . Instead of defunding Planned Parenthood, we should expand it so that every woman in this country gets the health care she needs."
"Pathetic, disgraceful, immoral. How else can I describe the Republican tax plan? It must be stopped."
Looking for an alternative? Tune in to tonight’s Medicare for All Town Hall at 7 PM ET on Facebook Live.
Thousands of transgender individuals are often disrespected and denied health care services due to their gender identity. That’s unacceptable. The Equality Act is an important first step to ensure the transgender community gets the respect and dignity they deserve. #PrideMonth

"We owe Native American people an enormous debt of gratitude for all they have taught us. From the. first days of this country Native Americans were lied to, their treaties violated and their needs ignored. On Indigenous Peoples’ Day let us commit to the fight for Native justice."
"Putin and his oligarch friends seek a divided world and the destruction of democracy. We must stand with the Ukrainian people against this war, and with the Russian people who are demonstrating against their corrupt, reckless president who started it."
"Republicans have not even signed their tax cuts for billionaires into law and they are already promising to make cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security."
"This is an unprecedented economic crisis. We must act right away to:. . —Keep every employee on their payroll and guarantee their wages. . —Provide $2,000 a month to every working-class man, woman and child in America"
"Let's be clear: Like every worker in America, nonprofit employees have a fundamental right to a union, good wages, benefits, paid time off, and a safe workplace."
It's an international embarrassment that the United States is the only major country on Earth that doesn’t guarantee health care to all people as a right. That has got to change. We need to pass Medicare for All now.
We're talking about 27 million Americans who will find it harder and harder to get their health care through community health centers because that program has not yet been reauthorized.
Americans deserve to know the truth about the 2016 election. Any attempt by the president to interfere with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation or pardon Cohen or Manafort would be a very serious offense.
21 states and 35 cities and counties raised their minimum wage today. The overwhelming majority of the American people understand that we must end starvation wages in America. Congress must act and raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $15 an hour.
"Have you been ripped off, bankrupted, or denied coverage by your insurer? Share your story with Bernie."
"I'm trying to figure out what the problem is with voting up or down on $2,000 direct payments to working people. Senate Republicans can't seem to give me a clear answer."
Rent is due. But over 40 million Americans lost their jobs because of this horrific pandemic. How are they expected to put together the income to make rent?. . It is time to cancel rent and mortgage payments until this crisis is over.
"Monday night at 7 PM ET, we are going to do what the mainstream media fails so often to do. We are going to talk about the most important issue facing us – climate change.. . Join us live on Twitter, Facebook and Youtube for a town hall on climate change:"
"I have long believed that democracy isn't just voting every four years—it’s about ordinary people creating community, engaging in the political process together, and building powerful grassroots movements to achieve progressive change. And that’s exactly what we’re doing."
@MonaChalabi Thank you @MonaChalabi for the important illustration of gun violence in our country.
What have we come to as a country when undocumented people are locked up and forced to be exposed to coronavirus with zero regard for their safety?. . We must dismantle our country's violent detention and deportation machine.
"The average cost of 4-year college in the United States: $23,091 . The average cost of 4-year college in France: $212.  . Education is one of the keys to a successful democracy, so why are we making it so hard for our people to learn?"
"Isn’t it strange how even as we end the longest war in our nation’s history, concerns about the deficit and national debt seem to melt away under the influence of the powerful Military Industrial Complex?"
"Under Trump, billionaires saw their wealth grow by $850 billion.. . At the exact same time, over 114,000 more infants, toddlers and preschoolers became uninsured.. . We need to be taking care of our children, not handing out corporate welfare to billionaires."
"Congratulations to the resident doctors at UVM, UMass and Stanford who have voted, overwhelmingly, to unionize. These doctors believe its unfair to their patients and themselves when they are forced to work up to 80 hours a week at very inadequate pay. They're right."
"I stand with the Amazon workers fighting for decent working conditions and a living wage on #PrimeDay.. . While Jeff Bezos' wealth increases by $275 million a day, Amazon workers are afraid to take bathroom breaks at work and are grossly underpaid."
"Today, I am demanding that Catalyst explain why they raised the price of this drug by $375,000. No one in the United States of America should die because they cannot afford the medication they need."
"It is grossly unfair for millions of workers in this country to be earning starvation wages, while the companies they work for make billions in profits and pay their CEOs outrageously high compensation packages."
We can start fixing the Affordable Care Act by creating a public option and lowering the Medicare eligibility age to 55. #HealthCareDebate
"Here's a radical idea: We should prioritize the health and economic wellbeing of our people—seniors, workers and small-business owners, children, and our most vulnerable community members—over welfare checks and bailouts for corporate CEOs and bankers on Wall Street."
Congratulations to the courageous workers and their unions at Disney World for their historic victory. I applaud everyone who stood up to demand that workers at one of the wealthiest corporations in the world should have a decent standard of living.
Don't be fooled by Trump when he talks about boosts to the stock market from his tax plan. That money is going to the wealthy and large corporations.
"On Trump's watch, 3,000 Americans died after Hurricane María. A new storm approaches and 33,000 Puerto Ricans still live under blue tarps..  . Trump's response? Divert $155 million from FEMA for migrant detention, complain about federal aid, and mock Puerto Rican officials. Insane."
"Where did the money from Trump's ""tax cuts for the middle class"" go? To wealthy corporations who have spent $1 trillion buying back their own stock to enrich executives and wealthy shareholders. That's not acceptable."
The Republicans who are suppressing the vote are terrified of how we could transform this country when millions more Americans are allowed to participate in our democracy. They are cowards.
"This is a tax bill written for massive corporations and wealthy Republican campaign contributors, not for the average American. It must be defeated."
Today at 11am ET we will be holding a hearing in the Senate Budget Committee to discuss an issue that doesn’t get talked about enough: the incredible concentration of ownership on Wall Street and its negative effect on millions of Americans.
"The annual Pentagon budget is $738,000,000,000.. . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is 1.5% the size.. . If we can find money on bombs and missiles to kill people, we can damn well afford to protect everyone's health and take care of each other."
"It is not a radical idea that when Americans turn on their taps, the drinking water should be clean.. . At 6:30 p.m. EST, tune in for a livestream of my discussion with @RepDebDingell and actor @MarkRuffalo regarding the cleanup of toxic PFAS chemicals."
"The expansion of the child tax credit this year has reduced child poverty in America by 40%. Incredible! But, if Build Back Better is not passed, that provision will soon expire and millions of children will be plunged back into poverty. Pathetic!"
I believe it is wrong to charge Americans astronomical prices for life-saving drugs developed with taxpayer dollars. You will not find me encouraging pharmaceutical companies to continue ripping off Americans like my Republican colleagues.
"At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, we will end the days of billionaires and large, profitable corporations not paying a nickel in federal income taxes. Yes. We will finally ask the very wealthy and largest corporations to pay their fair share of taxes."
You can call me a lot of things but you cannot call me inconsistent. Our country must join every other major nation of the world and guarantee health care as a human right. . . I hope we are not going to keep debating this for another 50 years. #MedicareforAll
"LIVE: At a time when half of older Americans have no retirement savings and millions of senior citizens are living in poverty, our job is to expand Social Security by demanding the wealthy pay their fair share."
"I don’t want to sound too partisan, but the Republican Party has made clear that they are not prepared to stand up for the American people and address the many crises facing working families today. We can get to work without them."
"Corporate tax loopholes have become so absurd that one five-story building in the Cayman Islands is “home” to nearly 20,000 corporations."

"If you paid $1 In federal income taxes, you paid more in taxes than: . . AT&T in 2021. Tesla in 2021. Amazon in 2017-2018. Nike in 2020. FedEx in 2020. Dish Network in 2020. Elon Musk in 2018 . Jeff Bezos in 2007 & 2011 . Carl Icahn in 2016-2017. . Yes. It’s time to tax the rich."
I am deeply concerned by the worsening humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia’s Tigray region. The United States must work together with the international community to press for an immediate ceasefire and deliver desperately needed aid to the region’s people.
"Trump’s shutdown is forcing furloughed workers to choose between paying for rent or chemotherapy.. . That is not a choice anyone in the wealthiest country in the history of the world should have to make.. . Mr. President, stop holding federal employees hostage. End the shutdown now."

"If we do not act on climate change now, our grandchildren are going to look us in the eyes 30 years from now and say, “What did you do? Didn’t you know? How did you let this happen?” We must lead the world in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels."
"The Acting Director of ICE can't bring himself to say that separating families is humane, yet he insists on continuing this horrifying policy."
In 2006 Kavanaugh told Congress he didn't know anything about the NSA warrantless wiretapping program prior to it being reported by the NYT. This year an email revealed that while at the White House he might have been involved in some conversations about this program. (3/x)

"The military budget is now about $780 billion a year. Over a 10-year period, that is more than DOUBLE what the reconciliation bill will be. And yet, I hear very little discussion about throwing money at the military industrial complex. Shocking!"
Congrats to Minor League baseball players for a huge and swift show of support for forming a union. The MLB and Commissioner Manfred should voluntarily recognize the union immediately and bargain in good faith.
Incredible. According to a new poll 70 percent of Americans now support Medicare for all—including 52 percent of Republicans! The momentum is with us.
The top 0.1% owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%. Republicans say that's not enough. 40% of their tax breaks go to the top 0.1%.
Thank you to the @AFLCIO for your resolution in support of Medicare for All. We can make health care a right.

"When Emperor Nero played his fiddle as Rome burned, at least he provided some entertainment to his court.. . Senator McConnell is doing nothing.. . This is the worst do-nothing Senate in modern American history. Every member of this body should be ashamed."

The Walton Family of Walmart owns more wealth than the bottom 40% of Americans. Meanwhile 55% of Walmart’s associates are food insecure. #CEOsvsWorkers
Jason Hargrove’s death is an outrage—it should've never happened. Blue-collar workers are risking their lives to keep this country running. They deserve better.. . The federal government must require that all frontline workers get protective gear NOW.
It’s time for us to join the rest of the world's rich countries and guarantee:. . 👷🏽‍♀️ Living wages. 💪🏾 Strong unions. 🏥 Universal health care. 🏖 Paid vacation and family leave. 👩🏽‍🎓 Tuition-free college. 🧓🏻 Retirement security. . Americans deserve to live with dignity too.

@MittRomney Every other major country on earth guarantees health care to all people as a human right. Why aren’t we joining that club?
The time for endless talk is over. We must vote on Build Back Better THIS MONTH. Let those who are opposed explain why. The vast majority in our caucus deserve a chance to show they can stand up to powerful special interests and represent working families. We must vote NOW.
"President Trump must not, in any way, try to derail or obstruct Bob Mueller's investigation."
Thousands of earthquake survivors have been sleeping outdoors for months and many can't afford to repair their homes.. . Trump's FEMA response is completely unacceptable. We can no longer tolerate the treatment of Puerto Ricans as second-class citizens.

Let’s cancel $1.6 trillion in student debt and make public universities tuition-free instead.

LIVE: Join me and Chuck Collins of the Institute for Policy Studies about how we can create a more equal society:
"It would've cost the typical American over $100,000 to receive the same care Trump received for free at Walter Reed. In the richest country on earth, every American should be able to receive the same quality health care as Trump. Health care is a human right, not a privilege."
"President Trump shut down the government, held 800,000 federal employees hostage and disrupted vital federal services for absolutely nothing. Pathetic!"
"In this moment of unprecedented crises, the Senate must respond through unprecedented action. We must put the needs of working families ahead of the needs of the wealthy and powerful. That is what this reconciliation bill is all about."
"As we speak, the re-negotiation of NAFTA is being done behind closed doors with 500 corporate lobbyists and executives who are working overtime to protect their interests at the expense of working people."
It is an outrage that we are still seeing intolerable acts of violence being perpetrated by police against black and brown people across the country. We need a societal transformation and real police and criminal justice reform. My thoughts are with Stephon’s family.
U.S. bombings are at a record high in 18 years of fighting in Afghanistan. Our service members continue to fight and die in America's longest war.. . The American people do not want endless war. We must bring our troops home.
"We are the wealthiest country in the world. Our full resources must be brought to fix not just this blackout, but the ongoing outages that have left hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans without power since Hurricane Maria."

This Republican mayor leads the first city in Texas powered by 100% renewable energy. Addressing climate change and creating millions of good-paying jobs in the process should not be a partisan issue.
"It's been 4,076 days since the federal minimum wage was last raised from $6.55 an hour to $7.25 an hour.. . During that same time period, billionaires have seen their wealth go up by more than $2,500,000,000,000.. . Our job: Increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour and tax the rich."
"As GDP grew over the past ten years, the minimum wage declined in real dollars, from $8.70 to $7.25.. . This is a disgrace. Working people were cheated out of billions.. . We must double the minimum wage to $15 an hour and give 40 million workers a raise—as a matter of justice."
"Trump is a good example that if you put your mind to it and work hard, you can betray just about every promise you make and deny every reality that exists."
We need a clean DREAM Act now
We will address the crisis in childcare by making sure that no working family pays more than 7 percent of their income on this basic need. Making child care more accessible and affordable will also strengthen our economy by allowing more Americans to join the work force.

Today I'm introducing legislation to hold the pharmaceutical companies and executives that created the opioid crisis accountable for the extraordinary harm they have caused.
The coronavirus reminds us that we are all in this together. These commonsense measures are critical to stopping the spread of the disease and protecting our most vulnerable people.. . It is absolutely essential that we start applying these practices in our daily lives right now.
"Why is it that year after year, our people are living shorter lives while we spend more and more on health care?. . Pharmaceutical profits are a big part of the story. . . If we want to solve the opioid crisis, their greed and criminality must come to an end."
"What was the corporate media discussing while we were talking about inequality in America? Let me guess, Stormy Daniels."

"When millions of Americans are struggling economically, when veterans are homeless and when 1 in 5 patients can't afford the medications they need, the U.S. shouldn't have this grotesque level of inequality. This is why we need a political revolution."
"Pharmaceutical corporate greed is literally killing people who cannot afford their medication. Together, we can change that."
It’s time for a windfall profits tax.
"Trump's Mexico tariffs aren't about trade, it's about a fake border ""crisis"" to scapegoat migrants. No wonder it's unpopular. We should be working to address migration’s root causes by ending our militarized drug war and race-to-the-bottom trade policies."
We must act immediately to end this humanitarian crisis.
"Mr. President, I doubt very much that you can “relate” to federal workers. . . When is the last time you had to choose between paying your mortgage, feeding your family or putting gas in the car? . . End the shutdown. Pay federal employees."
"Just in time for the new school year, billionaire Betsy DeVos wants to make it harder for students who were the victims of fraud to get their debts cancelled. She has got to be the worst Secretary of Education in the modern history of our country."
Are you a student or recent graduate? Apply for an internship with Senator Sanders. Applications are due on March 16.
I'm LIVE to talk about the reconciliation bill that a number of us are fighting for and to make some brief comments about what Sen. Joe Manchin said today about the legislation.
The greed of corporate executives and the billionaire class is destroying this country and whether they like it or not we are going to stop that greed.
"Never forget. Over 2 years ago, Trump and the GOP Congress looted the Treasury to give a $1 trillion tax break to the top 1% and large corporations. Now, Trump is working overtime to defund Social Security and the Postal Service. That is the type of looting we have got to end."
"""Out of an abundance of caution,"" we should expand Medicare to cover everyone in America."
Now is the time to reassess our national priorities. Now is the time to fight for real change.
"Iran is facing a catastrophic toll from the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. sanctions should not be contributing to this humanitarian disaster..  . As a caring nation, we must lift any sanctions hurting Iran’s ability to address this crisis, including financial sanctions."
This extension is important and will bring much-needed relief to millions. But we can’t stop here. We must continue fighting to cancel student debt and make public colleges and universities tuition-free and debt-free.
"Finally, it is my hope that this legislation will restore the American people’s faith in their government by proving that it works for them, not just the wealthy and powerful and their lobbyists."
"The American people increasingly understand that now is the time to think boldly and act decisively.. . We must move rapidly to a Medicare for All, single-payer system that treats health care as a human right."
"The pharmaceutical industry, over the last 20 years, has spent over $4.5 billion dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions. They have hundreds of lobbyists on Capitol Hill right now to fight any bill that will lower the cost of prescription drugs."
"LIVE: I’m joining two strong progressive voices, @DavidLammy and @delarabur, to discuss the international progressive response to Russia’s war on Ukraine."
"Big surprise: the president is a liar. Far from ""ending the endless wars,"" Mr. Trump has ended no wars and deployed more troops to the Middle East."
The average cashier at McDonald's would have to work for 895 years to make what the company's CEO makes in one year. That is insane.
"Apple, which has received $726 million in corporate welfare and government handouts over the last 30 years, will get a $48 billion tax cut from Republicans."
As a nation we have a choice: are we going to join every other major country and make health care a right? Or will we continue to allow insurance and pharma companies to make huge profits off of people's suffering?
"We need a budget that reflects the needs of working families, not just the wealthy, the powerful and large campaign contributors."
Poll after poll shows that over 80 percent of the American people believe that we should protect the legal status of Dreamers and provide them with a path toward citizenship. We need to pass the bipartisan DREAM Act now. #BernieResponds
"Public college tuition:. 🇩🇰 $0 . 🇫🇮 $0. 🇳🇴 $0. 🇸🇪 $0. 🇨🇿 $0. 🇮🇸 $0. 🇲🇽 $0.  . 🇺🇸 $10,230.  . Please do not tell me that in the richest country in the world, we cannot tax Wall Street to provide free higher education for all people—instead of crushing them under mountains of debt."

"At a time when climate change is the greatest crisis facing the planet, Microsoft and Google are making billion dollar deals with the fossil fuel industry. . . Our job: Break our addiction to fossil fuels and transform our energy system toward sustainable sources of energy."
Thank you President Obama for supporting Medicare for All. . . His support takes us another step toward ensuring that no one in the richest country in the history of the world has to forego health care because they cannot afford it.
A Green New Deal isn't just about the climate—it is about preventing hunger and illness. The time for incremental change has passed. We must fight to rapidly transform our energy system.
"I don't often agree with George Will, a conservative columnist. But he's right on this issue. It's an outrage that millions of Americans are denied the right to vote because of felony convictions."
We spend more on the military than the next 10 countries combined. . . Now Trump is proposing an $861 billion increase in base defense spending over 10 years. . . And he wants to pay for it by cutting over $1 trillion from programs working families depend on. That is a disgrace.
Congratulations to everyone in California who successfully pushed for this incredibly important law to move the state’s electric grid to 100% clean energy by no later than 2045. This bill is a step in the right direction.
Fox News heard out an alleged alien abductee after spending a week doubting Christine Blasy Ford's allegations against Brett Kavanaugh.

"The inventors of insulin sold their patents for $1 in 1923. And yet, the price of insulin in America has gone up by over 1,000% since 1999 causing 1.3 million diabetics in our country to ration insulin last year. It should not cost 10x more for insulin than it does in Canada."
"For far too long, it has not been Congress that has been regulating the pharmaceutical industry. It has been the pharmaceutical industry that has been regulating Congress."
"If employers in this country simply paid workers a living wage, taxpayers would save about $150 billion a year on federal assistance programs and millions of workers would be able to live in dignity and security."
"Disgusting. Jeff Bezos became the richest man on Earth while spying on, underpaying, and mistreating his workers.. . We must build a powerful trade union movement to stand up to the billionaire class and finally say: Enough. You cannot have it all."

American Airlines made $1.9 billion in profits last year. Their workers should not have to rely on public assistance programs like food stamps and Medicaid to try to get by.
"11,000 coronavirus cases are tied to Tyson Foods, Smithfield Foods and JBS. It is our meat processing workers and other so-called ""low-level"" employees who now face the greatest risk of illness and death.. . I don't care where you work. Our job is to keep all people alive."
The construction of a wall to keep unwelcome visitors out makes a lot of sense — if you were living under the Ming Dynasty in China in the 15th century when the Great Wall of China was expanded.
Who in their right mind believes now is the time to give massive tax breaks to billionaires? #TaxDebate
"The foundations of American democracy are threatened not only by extremism, but by ignorance and lack of knowledge. It is hard to ask people to have faith in their government when they have little understanding of what their government is trying to do."
What we are doing tonight is a big deal. We are going to talk about what really matters to the American people. I hope you will join us in watching on Facebook at 7 ET.
Workers in America have earned their retirement benefits from a lifetime of hard work. We cannot allow Paul Ryan to destroy these programs.
1) We correctly state that the Mercatus report found that the American people would save $2 trillion over 10 years under Medicare for All. That finding is right here in Table 2 of the Mercatus study.
A war with Iran would be a disaster and lead to endless conflict in the region. Congress must assert its constitutional authority and stop Trump from going to war.
"Amazon is paying some of its employees to tweet positive stories about the company. Hmm, why is that?"
"1 in 7 older Americans rely on Social Security for more than 90% of their income. Maybe, just maybe, instead of cutting Social Security, we should expand it."
Nearly half of American adults have had an immediate family member incarcerated at some point. HALF.. . Imagine what we could accomplish if we invested in jobs and education instead of paying $80 billion a year to lock up 2.2 million people.
"Today, with the passage of this budget resolution to provide relief to our working families, we have the opportunity not only to address the pandemic and the economic collapse—we have the opportunity to give hope to the American people and restore faith in our government."
Amazon's workers are speaking out to say: Jeff Bezos should not be in the business of fossil fuel extraction.. . The company’s response? Retaliate with threats of firing.. . I stand with these employees who are fighting to protect the only home we have.
Rob Malley is an extremely knowledgeable expert with great experience in promoting U.S. security through diplomacy rather than war. He would be an excellent choice for the role of Iran envoy.
"Our health care system is dysfunctional in many ways, but one of the most critical is that we are facing a major doctor shortage. We're holding a hearing NOW on what Congress can do about it."
"It is not a radical idea to say that in the richest country in the world, when Americans turn on their taps, their drinking water should be safe to drink. The polluters must pay to end toxic PFAS contamination of our water across the country."
Attorney General Barr's handling of the Mueller report has been a disaster. This is what I feared and why I opposed his nomination. I look forward to Special Counsel Mueller's testimony and believe Congress must continue to investigate whether the president obstructed justice.
Taxpayers provided funding for the development of this drug. Now Gilead is price-gouging off it during a pandemic. Beyond disgusting. . . Coronavirus treatment must be free to all.
"Republicans, listen to what the Pentagon told us: We cannot continue this uncertainty. How the hell do you run a military on a month-to-month basis. You can't do it. Republicans, do your job. Run the damn government."
"Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple made over $54 billion in profits last quarter. During the pandemic, the founding families of these companies got $280 billion richer while 20% of small businesses shut down.. . It's time to break up big tech and tax their obscene gains in wealth."
"All across the country workers are standing up and saying, “we want dignity, we want respect, we want justice.” Let’s stand with them."
Congress must reassert its Constitutional authority over the issue of war
Greedy Wall Street vulture funds must not be allowed to reap huge profits off the suffering and misery of the Puerto Rican people for a second longer.
"I said it in 1993 and I will say it again now: If you want a simpler, more cost-effective health care system, the way forward is a Medicare for All, single-payer program."
.@AOC and I stand with the Puerto Ricans who flooded into the streets to demand democratic control over their lives. .  . Puerto Rico's working families have suffered enough austerity. It's time to impose some austerity on the banks destroying the island.
The U.S. Congress has got to do more than increase military spending and give tax breaks to billionaires. We are here to protect working families.
"This president is going to have to learn that he is not a dictator, that there is a Constitution and a separation of powers in this country."
This is precisely why I recently introduced the College for All Act:
I say to the right-wing extremists who want to roll back Roe v. Wade: Abortion is a constitutional right and we are going to keep it that way.
"For the sake of Israelis and Palestinians alike, the United States must act urgently to help relieve the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip."
"There's no greater disservice to our veterans than to deny them the VA health care they've earned by draining the VA of its resources in order to line the pockets of corporate CEOs. . . If Trump thinks privatizing the VA is what's best for our veterans, he is dead wrong."
"Senior citizens in America should not have to be toothless or lack hearing aids or eyeglasses. Dental care, hearing and vision are essential parts of healthcare. The American people want us to expand Medicare to cover these basic services. That's what we must do."
President Biden is right: The big oil companies must stop profiteering and bring down gas prices. But we need more than a tweet. It's time for the President to demand that Congress pass a windfall profits tax on Big Oil and use the revenue to provide rebates to consumers NOW!
"Jane and I wish you a safe and merry Christmas, and happy holidays. This has been an enormously difficult year for far too many. As we head into the new year, let us rededicate ourselves to building a world of peace, justice and compassion for all."
What are the benefits of a publicly funded health care system? This Canadian doctor explains:
"I'm live on the floor of the Senate discussing why I support expanding U.S. production of microchips and semi-conductors but don’t support providing over $50 billion in corporate welfare to large, profitable corporations with no strings attached."
"Every time a minimum wage increase has been proposed, the extreme right wing and their billionaire campaign contributors claim that jobs will be destroyed. . . They have been proven dead wrong. It is time to raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour."
Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure is important. Addressing the long-neglected needs of working families is even more important. And we MUST address the existential threat of climate change. There can be no infrastructure bill without a reconciliation bill.
"My question for Jeff Bezos is simple: you are worth $182 billion, so why are you trying to make it harder for your workers to organize for higher wages and better benefits? What is your problem?"
"Question: Given the overwhelming support of the reconciliation bill from the American people, why is it taking so long for Congress to pass this bill?.  . Answer: Follow the money."

"If ICE agents show up at your door, know your rights.. Si agentes del ICE llegan a tu puerta, conoce tus derechos."
"As people are getting laid off and families are worried about their next meal, it is truly beyond my comprehension why the Trump Administration is fighting to kick 700,000 people off nutrition assistance in the middle of this pandemic."
"This must not go unnoticed. The Trump administration just announced their extremely dangerous plan to repeal the Clean Power Plan. Mr. Trump: You are threatening not only this generation, but you're threatening the lives of our children and grandchildren."
"Many of my Republican colleagues don't believe that climate change is real, or they don't believe that we should do anything about it. They are dead wrong. . . If we are to build a future for our children and grandchildren, we must begin by addressing the climate crisis. Period."
"Mr. President. Do you want to know what a real ""national emergency"" is? The scientists tell us that if we don't combat climate change aggressively, the severe damage done to our country and planet will be irreversible. Now that's a ""crisis."""
Thankfully there is a way to make sure that nobody has to delay or cancel the care they need because they can't afford it. #MedicareForAll
Even Fox News is fed up with Trump's pathetic and evidence-free conspiracy theories.
"This Memorial Day, we say to veterans who came home from war that we honor your service, and we will make sure every man and woman who has served our country gets the very best health care they can through a strong Veterans Administration."
"In the United States, you should not be in danger of losing your home because you get sick. We need to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower drug prices."
Ronald Reagan's own advisors understand that giving tax breaks to the wealthiest individuals is a disaster. #CNNDebateNight
"For many families, no action is needed to receive payments. But make sure to file your 2020 taxes as soon as possible to ensure you receive what you're owed. If you don’t normally file a tax return, you can register to receive your payments using the IRS Non-filer Sign-up tool."
"For vulture fund CEO Paul Singer, it seems having $3.5 billion is not enough. He is now trying to profit from taking AT&T workers' jobs, wages and benefits. . . @RoKhanna and @CWAUnion are right. We must tell the Paul Singers of the world: Enough is enough."
"If it is true that the Saudi regime murdered Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist critic, in their own consulate, there must be accountability, and an unequivocal condemnation by the United States. #SandersSAIS"
"""The medication I am taking costs $1000 a month.. . The same medication costs $3 in Brazil and India.. . The drug companies say they need it for research.. . That is a bald-faced lie."" — HIV survivor Reginald Brown"
Watch @docdanielle debunk one of President Trump's outrageous single-payer myths:
"Hundreds of thousands of Americans, convicted of nothing, are in jail because they can't afford cash bail—and Wall Street has been profiting from their incarceration. . . What a disgrace. Poverty is not a crime. Abolish cash bail."
No financial institution should be so large that its failure would cause catastrophic risk to millions of Americans or to our nation’s economic wellbeing.
"Call me radical, but I happen to believe that no one should have to work more than 1 job to live with dignity."
"The Republican idea of democracy is voter suppression, extreme gerrymandering, and billionaires buying elections."
"The federal government must immediately put together the necessary staffing and technology to address the unprecedented number of requests for help that are coming in.. . This is a crisis. No business as usual. People need help NOW, not in several months."
"The COVID-relief bill that Congress will vote on today will help many, but goes nowhere near far enough. The Biden Administration, on day 1, must bring forth a major economic relief bill that addresses the severe economic pain of working families— including more direct payments."
"This is the 7th mass shooting in 7 days, less than a week after the attacks in Atlanta..  . We cannot stand by as these tragedies happen again and again..  . Congress must take on the corrupting influence of the NRA, and pass the common sense gun safety legislation Americans want."
"Republican plan:. 1. Run up the deficit with tax breaks for the wealthy. 2. Freak out about the deficit. 3. Cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid to bring down the deficit"
"Republicans all over the country are trying to make it harder for people of color, poor people, and older people to participate in our democracy. . . Our agenda:. 🗳️ Extend early voting. 🌃 Extend voting hours. 🇺🇸 Make #ElectionDay a holiday"
"In Vermont, Planned Parenthood is the only provider of Title X services, and without federal funding, their ability to serve thousands of low-income Vermonters will be seriously limited."
I happen to believe we should go in the direction of a paycheck security process which says to every worker in America: you will continue to receive your paycheck and benefits during this crisis.
"Harry Reid was an outstanding leader and a friend. I have fond memories of working with him on important issues impacting working families, including the vast expansion of community health centers. Jane and I will miss him and send our condolences to Landra and the entire family."
Senator Schumer is right. Congress has got to stand up for the Constitution and tell this lawless president: We are not giving you a Pentagon bill that allows you to partner with the despotic Saudi regime in its horrific war in Yemen.
"Corporate greed is Pacific Gas & Electric handing out a $51 million compensation package to its CEO after triggering the 2nd largest wildfire in California's history, increasing rates by 22%, lobbying against rooftop solar and advocating for a solar tax. We need a Green New Deal."
"I introduced an amendment with @HawleyMO that would provide a direct payment of $1,200 for working-class individuals, $2,400 for couples and $500 for kids.. . If that amendment was signed into law, what would it mean for you and your family?"
"I cannot, for the life of me, begin to understand the cruelty of a president who—just two years after passing a $1.5 trillion tax giveaway to the rich—is now cutting food assistance to 700,000 hungry people.. . We have all the resources we need to eradicate hunger in America."
"Dwight D. Eisenhower was not a radical socialist—he was a Republican. And in 1961, he tried to warn us about the ""military industrial complex."""
"Billy Foister was one of 125,000 Americans toiling in Amazon's warehouses for Jeff Bezos—a billionaire who makes $150,000 per minute. Just sickening. @OSHA_DOL must launch a comprehensive investigation now."
This behavior toward @RepJayapal as she performed her House duties is unacceptable. . . I voted against creating ICE because I feared the agency and its leaders would act with impunity. We need an immigration system that respects human rights and Congress's oversight authority.
"Combining these pieces of legislation would push the price tag of the bill to over $1 trillion – with very little scrutiny. Meanwhile, we've spent month after month discussing if we can afford to protect the children, the elderly, the sick, the poor and the future of our planet."
We have never seen this level of corporate greed in America. Let’s go through a few examples.
"Today's announcement that the White House will end military support for the Saudi-led war in the Yemen war is a tribute to the work of so many activists over the years.. . Yemen needs food, medicine, and health care—not bombs and blockades."
"Never Forget: . . 83% of the Trump tax breaks are going to the top 1%.. . 87% of Biden's student loan benefits are going to individuals making $75,000 or less and 0% are going to the top 1%.. . Yes. It's about time we stood up for working class families."
What's it like fleeing a wildfire? Listen to this nurse describe how she and her team narrowly escaped California's recent climate change-fueled disasters.
"As the Supreme Court today hears a case on Roe v. Wade, let me be very clear. It is a woman who has the right to control her own body, not the government. If men were the ones giving birth, I doubt that this would be in question."
TODAY at 11am ET: I’ll be LIVE on the floor of the U.S. Senate to speak about how climate change is already ravaging our planet and why now is not the time to fast-track the construction of a natural gas pipeline in West Virginia. Tune in.
"While CEO pay has exploded, the minimum wage has lost more than 15 percent of its value since the last time it was raised. This is a starvation wage for 40 million people and everyone knows it. . . Congress must stand with the working people of this country. #RaisetheWage"
Jane and I send our deepest condolences to the loved ones of Officer William Evans who was killed protecting the Capitol. Our thoughts are also with the officer who remains hospitalized from today’s attack.
"Thank you to the @nwlc for your strong advocacy on this issue. All families must have access to affordable child care, and that is why we just doubled funding to expand child care and development in America."
The Civilian Climate Corps will provide good jobs and educational benefits to hundreds of thousands of young people who will lead the fight against climate change and help save the planet. Let's get it done.
For decades our government has stood up for the rich and the powerful. It’s time for the government to stand up for the working class of this country.
"A single mother making $25,000 with a 2-year-old will receive a total of $3,600, including 6 monthly payments of $300 and an additional $1,800 as part of her 2021 tax return."
"We have all the tools we need to end AIDS deaths and HIV transmissions. We just need the political will. We must do all we can, together, to rid the world of this terrible disease. #WorldAIDSDay"
You’re not a “different” kind of Republican by proposing a budget that would eliminate heating assistance to 6 million families in this country by abolishing the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program.
Mitch McConnell is many things but he’s not dumb. He knows how to count. Bringing up a vote he knew was doomed an hour before the government shut down was absolutely irresponsible. This falls on his shoulders.
"We have a racist criminal justice system that costs us billions of dollars, ruins lives and allows private prisons to profit off of human misery. The private prison racket has got to end."
"If we can afford to give $740 billion to the Pentagon, please don’t tell me we can’t afford to eliminate homelessness in America and cancel the rent during a pandemic. Instead of more bombs and more missiles, we need more jobs, more rent relief and more affordable housing."
"The Trump budget is morally bankrupt and bad economic policy. It pays for his tax breaks for the rich and large corporations by slashing Medicaid by $1.3 trillion, cutting Medicare by $554 billion and slicing $10 billion from the Social Security Disability Insurance Program."
"Maybe—just maybe—instead of spending $1.8 trillion a year on military budgets and weapons of destruction designed to kill each other, we can pool our resources as a planet to fight our common enemy: climate change."
"As a candidate, Trump promised he'd stop outsourcing good-paying American jobs. He lied. . . Instead, by protecting their patents, Trump is trying to make it easier for corporations like Pfizer, GE, Boeing and Microsoft to ship more American jobs to China."
"Corporate greed is Netflix making a record-breaking $5.1 billion profit, giving its CEO $43 million in total compensation, avoiding over $1 billion in taxes and paying a 1.1% effective federal income tax rate – a lower tax rate than a nurse, teacher or truck driver. #TaxTheRich"
"Today we learned that the State Department's legislative affairs staff is led by a former lobbyist for arms manufacturer Raytheon. This is how the billionaire class profits off of the devastation of Yemen, the poorest country in the Middle East."
"I’ll be damned if when a COVID-19 vaccine is developed, more people die because they can’t afford to purchase it. Any life-saving vaccine must be free."
"What a hypocrite! @realDonaldTrump makes hateful and racist rants every day about how immigrants are “bad” for the country, but he had no problem hiring undocumented immigrants to help him build the Trump Hotel in DC or Trump Tower in New York City."
"In The Divine Comedy, Dante reserved a special place in the Seventh Circle of Hell for people who charged usurious interest rates. Today we don’t need the hellfire, but we do need a national usury law that caps interest rates on credit cards and consumer loans at 15 percent."
"Now is the time, finally, for Congress to stand up for working families and take on the big money interests and wealthy campaign contributors who have so much power over the economic and political life of our country."
"Dwight D. Eisenhower was not a radical socialist, he was a Republican. And he tried to warn us about the ""military industrial complex."""
"Republicans' budget would cut Medicare by at least $450 billion, but would give billionaires, including President Trump, huge tax breaks."
Judge Kavanaugh testified he treated women “as friends and equals” and “with dignity and respect.” Numerous entries in his school yearbook would seem to contradict this. Was Judge Kavanaugh’s statement to the committee truthful? (8/x)
"Every 10 minutes, a child under the age of five dies of preventable causes in Yemen. What few Americans know, however, is that the U.S. military is making the crisis worse by helping one side in the conflict bomb innocent civilians."
"As I said at the time, it was shameful to give Trump a huge Pentagon budget without putting real limits on his abuse of power..  . Now he's unconstitutionally diverting $7 billion to build his border wall.. . When will Congress finally have the guts to rein in this lawless president?"
"Thank you, Reginald Brown, for sharing your story. I am proud to stand with you to make sure we do not go backward on health care. We are fighting for Medicare for All to make sure that Reginald and every HIV-positive American can afford the lifesaving medicine they need to live."
"Are you a student or recent graduate? Apply for a paid internship in Senator Sanders' Burlington and Washington, D.C. offices. Applications are due at 11:59 pm on Saturday, 3/16."
"Wealth and income inequality is now so extreme that the top 1% is literally taking $2.5 trillion away from the bottom 90% each and every year. It's time to end trickle-down economics, raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and create an economy that works for all, not just the 1%."
"Congress must act now or 2,800 community health centers will close and millions will lose access to health care."
"At a time when there are so many vulnerable seniors out there whose entire income is Social Security, we cannot tolerate any cuts.. . No senior should live in poverty. We must expand Social Security so every American can retire with the dignity and the respect they deserve."
High-income countries around the world have figured out how to do universal health care. Why can't Republicans understand that?
"We must reassure the American people that vote-by-mail is safe, every ballot will be counted, and our election will be free and fair.. . @SenSchumer and I are calling on Sen. McConnell to act in a bipartisan way to restore public confidence in our democracy."
"The Republicans, who control the Senate, House and White House, must not be allowed to shut down the government. They must work in a bipartisan way to pass a budget which reflects the needs of all Americans, not just wealthy campaign contributors."
"While other states are making it harder to vote, I’m proud that Vermont is leading the nation by making it easier to participate in the political process. If we believe in a vibrant democracy, we need to have the highest voter turnout in the world."
Donald Trump's choice for Social Security Commissioner wants to CUT Social Security.
"Since 1990, 4 defense contractors (including Lockheed & Boeing) spent over $714 million on lobbying and campaign contributions. Yesterday, their wish for endless war was granted while children in America go hungry and veterans sleep on the street."
"The ecological crisis has gotten worse and worse, decade after decade, and yet the corporate media still refuse to take it seriously.. . We will not bring about the political change needed to tackle the climate emergency until we address this."
No. We don't need to end $300 a week in emergency unemployment benefits that workers desperately need. We need to end starvation wages in America. If $300 a week is preventing employers from hiring low-wage workers there's a simple solution: Raise your wages. Pay decent benefits.
I do not believe that men and women fought and died for our right to vote so that billionaires could buy elections. We must move to real campaign finance reform and public funding of elections.
"In the midst of this economic downturn goal, the goal right now must be for the government to make whole and protect all of the working families in this country."
"Amazon, Delta, Starbucks, Chevron and General Motors each paid $0 in federal taxes..  . If these five companies paid their 21% corporate tax rate, we'd have enough revenue to end homelessness in America and stop the horror of people dying in the cold."
Vermonters: Join me this Labor Day Weekend for town meetings across the state with live music and food! I’ll be discussing the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill and how it will finally address the needs of working families here in Vermont and all across our country.
"In this crisis, we have got to pay more attention to the most vulnerable. Mothers are skipping meals to feed their kids right now. Who’s going to respond to them?. . We must guarantee the health, nutrition, shelter, and economic wellbeing of all our people."
"A rigged economic and political system is when billionaires spend $1.2 billion in campaign contributions to buy politicians in the last election, become $2 trillion richer during the pandemic and pay a lower effective tax rate than a nurse. Yes, we must abolish Citizens United."
"The goal of space exploration should be to benefit the people in the United States and the world community. It should not be about making trillions of dollars for Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and a few other billionaires."
"57 years ago, hundreds of thousands of people came together for the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. We are still fighting for many of the demands being made then.. . Today, we will not only honor the memory of that march, but also carry on the struggle for racial justice."
"Congress must finally stand up to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry. Medicare must negotiate prescription drug prices, and we must use the $450 billion in savings to expand Medicare to cover dental, hearing and vision. We must also lower Medicare age eligibility."
"We still can't import medicine from Canada at a fraction of the price. My bill, the Affordable and Safe Prescription Drug Importation Act, ends this absurdity. We can lower drug prices and save lives. . . Does @realDonaldTrump have the guts to stand up to Big Pharma’s greed?"
"1) We must seriously strengthen universal background checks, including ending the gun show loophole. Background checks don't mean anything if somebody can go into a gun show or the internet and buy weapons without undergoing any background check."
"Does anyone really believe Trump is concerned with human rights in Iran, when he’s had only kind things to say about authoritarians around the world, including Putin in Russia, Kim Jong Un in North Korea, Duterte in the Philippines and Mohammad Bin Salman in Saudi Arabia?"
"Income and wealth inequality is soaring, wages for workers have been stagnant for almost 50 years and some billionaires pay nothing in federal income taxes. Hey! Maybe it's time for the government to start representing the middle class, and not just the 1%."
"Senate Republicans are ramming through Trump's far-right Supreme Court nominee just nine days before Election Day, as over 50 million Americans have already cast their ballots.. . The entire process to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court is illegitimate."
"On #NationalImmigrantsDay, I am proud of our country for welcoming millions around the world seeking refuge from violence, racism and poverty—people like my father who came here from Poland at the age of 17.. . This is the America that we must be."
"Mr. President. Your shutdown is not only hurting federal employees and people who need government services, it's now impacting the general public and the whole economy. End your shutdown now. Pay federal workers."
The U.S. must stop its unconstitutional and unauthorized participation in this war and support the UN’s effort to get a cease-fire. No child should have to live like this.
"Now, thanks to the FCC under Mr. Trump, many Americans will only be able to choose from three huge corporations for their wireless service: Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile..  . This trend of unending corporate consolidation goes against the interests of consumers and our democracy."
"The Walton family, the owners of Wal-Mart, is the wealthiest family in America. Middle class taxpayers should not have to subsidize Walmart’s low wages to the tune of at least $6.2 billion each and every year. That's absurd."
"Instead of repealing the estate tax and giving a massive tax cut to the Walton family and Kochs as Mitch McConnell and Trump want to do, let’s substantially increase this tax on multi-millionaires and billionaires and reduce wealth inequality in America."
"Think of how crazy you have to be, in the middle of a mass-extinction event, to try to destroy the Endangered Species Act.. . I’m sure Trump’s friends in the fossil fuel and mineral industries are happy with his attack on our biodiversity."
"The American people deserve and require leadership from Washington that acts aggressively, puts working people first, and provides peace of mind to the most vulnerable people in our country.. . We must act with love, compassion and urgency."
The U.S. Department of Labor has the authority to prevent companies like Amazon that have violated labor laws from receiving federal contracts. Taxpayer dollars should not go to companies and multi-billionaires like Jeff Bezos who repeatedly break the law. Let's get this done.
"Medicare must not significantly raise premiums in order to pay $56,000 a year for a drug of questionable value. This is precisely why Medicare should be negotiating prices with the pharmaceutical industry."
"As corporate CEOs come asking the government for welfare checks, and Senate Republicans arrange for a $500 billion slush fund for them, Congress must stand firm: No stock buybacks allowed for companies seeking bailouts."
"MONDAY NIGHT: Our next livestreamed town hall, this time on the Iran nuclear deal. Tune in at 7 ET:"
"President-Elect Biden's COVID rescue plan will begin to provide our people with much-needed support, such as $2,000 direct payments and a $15 minimum wage.. . I look forward to working with him and my colleagues in Congress to urgently provide bold relief to working families."
Do you have a question about Medicare for All? Submit a video question here and you might get it answered at the Medicare for All Town Hall tomorrow night.
"We're talking about the need to provide adequate disaster relief for the people of Texas, Florida, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico – an island where hundreds of thousands are still without electricity."
"This is what a rigged economy looks like. On the same day a bill was signed into law to give a $76 billion blank check to micro-chip companies, Intel announced it will be cutting back on plans to increase jobs by $4 billion while increasing dividends for its wealthy shareholders."
"U.S. bombs, logistical support, and intelligence for the Saudi dictatorship's airstrikes make us complicit in this nightmare.. . Congress has declared this war unconstitutional. We must now stand up to Trump and defund all U.S. involvement in these horrors."
"BREAKING: The U.S. government released horrifying footage of a child detention center in Texas. Together, we must defeat this inhumane and un-American action."
"Today, millions of climate strikers, led by a global youth movement, showed politicians around the world that the demand for environmental justice is not going away. It is only growing stronger. Together, we will pass a Green New Deal."
"How is it that while the very, very wealthiest Americans have never had it so good, the middle class has been in decline for the last 30 years?"
President Trump’s State of the Union needs a response. Here’s mine.
"As it happens, I personally believe that it is totally appropriate for the UN to focus on poverty in the United States – the richest county in the history of the world."
"Residents should not have to work 80 hours each week in a hospital. It was an honor to meet with residents at UVM Medical Center who are organizing a union in order to provide not only decent wages and working conditions, but to improve care for their patients."
"40 years ago, more than 25% of all workers belonged to a union. Today: only 10%.. . The decline of the American middle class over the past forty years is no coincidence.. . We must rebuild the labor movement and make it easier, not harder, for workers to join unions."
"5) Finally, we must make it easier for law enforcement to keep guns away from those accused of domestic violence or under a restraining order."
It’s good to see the Trump administration finally admit what some of us have been saying for a long time: the disastrous war in Yemen must end. . . Next month the Senate will have the chance to show we are serious about ending US support for this war by voting on SJ Res 54.
"This is a major victory for the millions-strong climate justice movement, which fought for years to stop this pipeline.. . Together, we will secure clean air and good jobs building a renewable-energy economy that protects the only planet we have."
"There were two questions for me to answer as a juror in the impeachment trial: whether President Trump is guilty of abusing his power as president for his own political gain, and whether he obstructed Congress in their investigation of him."
"We should be the ones pushing hardest for a ceasefire in Yemen, not standing in the way of one. The Senate must vote to end US military support for this catastrophe, so we can focus on humanitarian aid and a diplomatic solution."
"In the midst of the pandemic, the economic collapse and climate change, Medicare for All, a $15 minimum wage, the Green New Deal, canceling student debt and taxing billionaires are not radical ideas.. . They are exactly what the American people want and need."
Minimum wage in Australia: $19.84 an hour. Unemployment rate in Australia: 6.6%. . U.S. federal minimum wage: $7.25 an hour. U.S. unemployment rate: 6.7%. . Please don't tell me raising the minimum wage to a living wage - at least $15 an hour - costs jobs.
"""The entire purpose of this is to lower middle class taxes."" –Paul Ryan. . ""Primarily, and priority number 1, is middle-class Americans."" –Sarah Huckabee Sanders. . ""The theme behind this bill is to get middle-class tax relief."" –Mitch McConnell. . The reality:"
"During the pandemic, 647 billionaires in America have become nearly $1 trillion richer and now own twice as much wealth as the bottom 50%, while 40 million Americans face eviction. A society cannot sustain itself when so few have so much while so many have so little. #TaxTheRich"
"Alex Acosta should never have been nominated as Labor Secretary. Now is the time to put an end to our two-tiered criminal justice system. We need a Labor Secretary who puts workers first, not billionaires—and certainly not billionaire sexual predators of underage girls."
"Linda Brown was an American heroine. Thanks to her struggle and sacrifice for equality, African American children today have greater access and better opportunities for quality education and higher-paying jobs. Linda Brown’s struggle for equality will live on forever."
"The pharmaceutical industry has spent over $4.5 billion on lobbying and campaign contributions over the past 20 years and has hired some 1,200 lobbyists to get Congress to do its bidding. They are the most powerful industry on Capitol Hill."
"Coronavirus has killed 2,600 in Iran, but U.S. sanctions are obstructing medicine and aid from getting in.. . @SecPompeo and @stevenmnuchin1: Pandemics know no borders. Let us put aside our countries' disputes and lift sanctions to reduce human suffering."
Does it make sense to anyone that the United States is the only major country on Earth not to guarantee paid family and medical leave? . . It’s time to end that international embarrassment.
"Given the president’s propensity to lie about almost everything, it is not surprising that Trump is grossly distorting what my Medicare for All legislation does.. . My response to his disastrous op-ed yesterday:"
Congratulations to Seattle for clearing past misdemeanor convictions for marijuana possession that were prosecuted before marijuana was legalized. We must decriminalize marijuana nationally and expunge federal marijuana use and possession crimes.
"But even more importantly, I regard it as absurd that the parliamentarian, a Senate staffer elected by no one, can prevent a wage increase for 32 million workers."
Profits in last 2 quarters. Exxon:⬆️228% to $38 billion. Chevron:⬆️149% to $23 billion. Shell:⬆️117% to $21 billion. . These companies are spending $63 billion in stock buybacks & dividends - a massive transfer of wealth from the working class to the top 1%. Windfall profits tax NOW!
"What frightens me is not only Trump's respect and admiration for tyrants all over the world, but his disrespect for democracy in our country.. . Our job is to stand together and say: Mr. Trump, in this country we believe in democracy, not authoritarianism."
"Mr. President, keep your promises. Today, get on the phone. Tell Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell that you will veto any bill that cuts Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid."
These hungry American children cannot get the same nutrition support as kids in the continental United States.. . It’s time to stop treating Puerto Rico like a colony. Our legislation makes adequate food assistance a right for all—including Puerto Ricans.
"The fact of the matter is there are more working class people than there are billionaires. Let’s stand up, fight back, and create the kind of nation we know we deserve."
"You don’t help working families by throwing more than 100,000 kids off of Head Start."
"If Democrats stand together to take on powerful special interests and do what so many working families of this country want us to do, we can create an economy that works for all, help save the planet from the ravages of climate change, and strengthen our democracy."
"Black babies make up only 14% of the infant population, yet make up 30% of all infant deaths. That is unacceptable. We must address the systemic and implicit racism present in maternal care for black mothers, as well as other mothers of color."
"When workers are laid off, they lose their employer-provided health insurance.. . That is why we need a universal, single-payer system that guarantees health care as a right to all our people.. . That is why we need Medicare for All."
"Delivery of royal baby: $8,900. Regular hospital birth in America: $10,808. #MedicareForAll"
"As a candidate, Donald Trump said he understood the pain that working families were feeling. . . Well, you’re not responding to that pain, Mr. President, when you kick 500,000 families out of their homes by gutting affordable housing programs."
"Let us have, as Dr. King stated, a “better distribution of wealth within this country for all of God’s children."""
"How does it happen that there are many major corporations in America where CEOs receive extravagant compensation packages, who pay their workers wages so low that many of them are forced to rely on food stamps to survive? #CEOsvsWorkers"
"The American people, the Congress and the courts must show Trump what the Constitution and separation of powers is about. Trump cannot declare a ""national emergency"" whenever he wants, and spend money on his pet project. Not gonna happen!"
"Unless we renew community health center funding, 70% of funds will be cut. 2,800 CHCs will close. And 9 million patients will lose care."
"Congratulations to teachers for leading this country forward. A nation which doesn’t educate its children properly will fail. Instead of spending billions on jails and incarceration, we must invest in our teachers and schools."
"Rent is due tomorrow. My question is this: with 40 million facing the threat of eviction, how in the world does Sen. McConnell think they're going to cobble up enough income to keep a roof over their heads during this crisis?. . It is time to cancel rent until this crisis is over."
This is America. The elderly shouldn't walk around without teeth and be unable to afford a dentist. Grandparents shouldn't be unable to talk with their family because they can't afford hearing aids. Seniors shouldn't be unable to read newspapers because they can’t afford glasses.
True tax rate for the 25 richest people in the United States: 3.4%. Average tax rate for a nurse: 24%. . A nurse should not pay more in income tax than a billionaire.
"$70,000 a minute. . $4 million per hour. . $100 million per day. . . That's how much the Walton family, the richest family in the world, made last year. . . I say to the Walton family: No more excuses. Pay your workers a living wage—at least $15 an hour."
I do believe that in their heart of hearts the American people want to see their government play a constructive role around the world and bring people together. #BernieTownHall
"If my Republican colleagues are so concerned about inflation maybe, just maybe, they should not have blocked the bill I introduced yesterday with Senator Klobuchar to cut prescription drug prices under Medicare in half by taking on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry."
"Under billionaire Eddie Lampert's watch 3,500 Sears stores closed and over 250,000 workers lost their jobs. Lampert must ensure a just transition for Sears workers who lost their jobs due to his greed. Workers deserve severance pay and to have their benefits honored."
Insulin should not cost 10 times as much in the United States as it does in Canada. Period.
Appalachians deal with dirty air and water because of the coal industry's greed. They are standing up and fighting back. @NRDems and I are committed to working with these communities to build just and healthy local economies as we tackle the climate crisis.
"As we see Republican-led voter suppression efforts across the country, I’m proud Vermont is expanding voting rights. Congress must act NOW to remove barriers to the ballot box and make it easier for people to vote, not harder."
"The richest 1% owe 70% of all unpaid taxes. With the money from these tax cheats, we could do all this:. . 👩🏽‍🎓Tuition-free college. 👩‍👦‍👦End child hunger. 🚰Clean water for all. 🏡Build 500,000 affordable homes. 😷Masks and PPE for all. 📬Fully fund the Post Office"
Too many Americans have fought and died to defend democracy. We cannot have a president who applauds a murdering despot as a ‘strong person’ who ‘truly loves his country.’
It is unacceptable that for so many working people it is incredibly hard to find affordable housing.
"I thank German Ambassador @AmbWittig for joining me in Vermont this past weekend. I have always believed it is important for us to learn about what goes on in other countries, and there is plenty to be learned from Germany."
"If you were born in 1973, the median wage went from $17 to $19 an hour over your lifetime. That’s it. Two bucks in 45 years. . . The top 1%'s annual income tripled: $480K to $1.45 million.. . That's why we need a political revolution. To build an economy for all of us—not the 1%."
"At a time when Trump is an unindicted co-conspirator in a crime, we shouldn’t confirm a Supreme Court justice picked by Trump, who believes the president cannot be indicted or deposed. The Senate must postpone Kavanaugh’s hearings until the ongoing investigations are complete."
"How do you explain the mentality of the billionaire Sackler family? They weren't content to destroy thousands of lives for profit in America—they had to push opioids on the people of China, too. . . The level of greed and cruelty is breathtaking."
"I am very disappointed that the Republican Party, which controls the White House, the House and the Senate, is pushing us closer and closer to a very dangerous government shutdown. They must not allow that. They have got to compromise."
"The American people are sick of airlines ripping them off, canceling flights at the last minute and delaying flights for hours on end. It's time for @SecretaryPete to fine airlines $55,000 per passenger for every flight cancellation they know can’t be fully staffed."
"It’s time we do what other industrialized countries do and understand that the most important investment we can make is in children. It’s time we make pre-K education for 3-and 4-year-olds free. Yes, that is right—free."
The US has nearly 17 times the gun homicide rate of Germany. So what's the difference? Our gun laws.
"Maybe, just maybe, Betsy DeVos and Donald Trump should listen to teachers and public health experts instead of threatening to cut funding for public schools."
Ted Cruz and Tim Scott should listen to these Patriotic Millionaires instead of their campaign contributors. #TaxDebate
"Remember the state of the economy before the pandemic:. . —Half of Americans lived paycheck to paycheck. —40% of adults didn't have $400 for an emergency. —87 million were uninsured or underinsured. —41 million workers made less than $15 an hour. . No. That was not a ""great economy."""
"My friend Senator Schumer is right. Trump's NAFTA does not even mention the words ""climate change""—the existential threat facing not only our country but the entire planet."
Mr. Trump made a series of disastrous choices this week—decisions that tear at the fabric of what this country is about. This is one of them. We must not turn our backs on refugees fleeing horrific violence and persecution around the world.
"The Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, with U.S. support, has killed thousands of civilians. Over 85,000 children have died of starvation.. . Enough is enough. The Senate must vote to end U.S. support for this war."
Congratulations to President Biden for having the courage to do what no president in modern history has done. He is standing with union organizers who are helping to grow the trade union movement. This is an important step forward for working families. Let's go forward together.
President Trump has failed to listen to science and we have all suffered because of it.. . Let's be serious and prioritize our health over the bank accounts of billionaires and large corporations.
"- Americans borrowed $88 billion last year to pay for health care. - 65 million people didn't seek treatment because of cost.  . That is outrageous. Under Medicare for All, no one would have to worry about being able to afford the health care they need."
"“Unless you were alive during the 1920s, you haven’t seen inequality like this.” –Chuck Collins"
"The Iranian people, led by young women, are demonstrating for their freedom and for a better life. The government has responded by killing dozens of protesters. I call upon the Iranian government to address the needs of their citizens, not kill them."
"The Republican agenda is clear:. . 1) Take health care away from 32 million Americans. 2) Give huge tax cuts to billionaires and large, profitable corporations. 3) Slash Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. 4) Allow the planet to be destroyed"
Share of workers at major corporations without paid sick leave:. . Sonic: 94%. Applebee's: 89%. Pizza Hut: 88%. Burger King: 86%. Subway: 86%. Domino's: 85%. Dunkin' Donuts: 85%. Wendy's: 84%. McDonald's: 78%. Chick-fil-A: 78%. Taco Bell: 77%. . We must make paid sick leave a right for all.
I applaud the activists whose efforts led the Trump Organization to cancel this event. Anti-Muslim bigotry has no place in American political life.
"The average amount of debt forgiveness to businesses receiving PPP loans: $95,700. If we could afford to cancel hundreds of billions in PPP loans to business owners in their time of need, please do not tell me we can't afford to cancel all student debt for 45 million Americans."
Raising the minimum wage by $1 could’ve prevented thousands of suicides a year.. . We will end the 40-year assault on the working class and the suffering it has caused for our people.. . Every job in America must pay a living wage of at least $15 an hour.
"“Let’s bring the death knell” to the fossil fuel industry, @NYCMayor says. ""Let’s prove that this is an economically unviable industry.”"
"The average registered nurse paid $11,526 in federal income taxes, while Donald Trump, the self-proclaimed billionaire, paid just $750. No. Paying less in taxes than working class Americans doesn't make Trump ""smart."" It makes him a bad businessman or a tax cheat— likely both."
"This act of domestic terrorism by a racist, anti-Semitic white supremacist using an AR-15 should be a call to action. . . Let us finally pass common sense gun safety reforms. We cannot grow numb to this violence, and we must show our nation can come together to address this hatred."
Why did Trump veto our bill to end the horrific U.S. role in Saudi Arabia's bombings of Yemeni children?. . Because we have a president who puts Raytheon's profits ahead of human life.. . It's time to rein in this corrupt White House and stop this war.
"What do I mean by a rigged economy? In the United States today, 745 billionaires now own more wealth than the bottom 60% of all our people combined..  . Enough. It's time to put working people first."
"The reality is that for many large corporations, wage theft has been an essential part of their business model. That has to change."
"Today, we say to the prison industrial complex: Yes. We're going to enact real criminal justice reform. And we start by ending private prisons and private detention centers. No more profiteering from locking people up."
"Our current system:. . 💰Creates $100 billion in health industry profits. ⚠️Keeps 87 million people uninsured or underinsured. 💳Bankrupts 500,000 people. 💊Makes drugs unaffordable. 📈Costs 2x per person with worse health outcomes than other rich countries. . We need Medicare for All."
"Latina workers lose $28,036 annually and $1,121,440 over 40 years compared to what white men make—because they are paid less. That's outrageous. This might be a ""radical"" idea, but maybe it's time for Latinas to get equal pay for equal work."
"Corporate greed is out of control. While Jeff Bezos became $78 billion richer during the pandemic, Amazon has paid ZERO in federal income taxes over the last 3 years and continues to deny hazard pay and paid sick leave to its workers. This must change."
You don’t help working people when your budget would eliminate financial aid to hundreds of thousands of low-income college students.
"For too long, drug companies and their lobbyists have bullied Congress into inaction while millions suffer. Enough is enough."
"Senator McConnell: Do not play politics with our response to the coronavirus. Congress has an obligation to end unconstitutional mass surveillance.. . No administration, and especially not this administration, can be allowed to have the unchecked power to spy on Americans."
"What is happening at the border right now constitutes torture, according to @amnesty. Separating parents from their children is inhumane and must be stopped."
"Our broken criminal justice system targets poor people and minorities disproportionately with the death penalty, including those who are innocent. The government should not be in the business of killing people. We must abolish capital punishment."
"No, Judge Benitez. AR-15 rifles are not equivalent to a Swiss Army knife. They are military style weapons that can, and have, killed dozens of people in a few minutes. The American people want common sense gun safety legislation. This decision should be appealed and overturned."
LIVE: Join us for the groundbreaking Inequality in America National Town Hall
We’re taking on corporate lobbyists..  . We’re taking on powerful special interests..  . We’re taking on the entire ruling class of this country..  . And poll after poll shows that is exactly what the American people want us to do.
LIVE: The Senate Budget Committee is holding a hearing on why we need to end a rigged and corrupt tax code that gives trillions of dollars in tax breaks to the wealthy and huge corporations.
Paid Family and Medical Leave by Country:.  . 43 weeks: Germany. 36 weeks: Japan. 35 weeks: Sweden. 27 weeks: Canada. 25 weeks: Italy. 25 weeks: South Korea. 18 weeks: France. 12 weeks: UK. 0: United States.  . Our job: Guarantee at least 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave.
Senate Republicans just gave a massive gift to Wall Street at the expense of everyone else in this country.
"If this report is true, Donald Trump committed obstruction of justice—a felony and a potentially impeachable offense. I am glad that the House will be investigating this serious issue."
"At a time when gun violence and school shootings are becoming more and more routine, the last thing we need is to enable anyone – including people who otherwise couldn’t legally purchase a gun – to ‘print’ a gun on a 3-D printer."
We have a health care system that is not designed to provide affordable health care to all. It's designed to make enormous profits for insurance companies and drug companies. #MedicareForAll
I rise to oppose the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court:
Wishing you and your loved ones a very safe and happy 4th of July.
Ending support for the Saudi war in Yemen is exactly what my colleagues and I tried to do earlier this year with SJ Res 54. Next month we will bring it back to the floor for another vote.
Then why are you supporting a bill that would raise taxes on 87 million middle class households? #TaxDebate
Here’s a radical idea: billionaires should pay their fair share.
"No, Chairman Powell. At a time when real weekly wages are lower today than they were nearly 50 years ago, the problem is not that wages and employment are too high. The problem is that corporations are making record profits by jacking up prices. We need a windfall profits tax."
"I stand with the people of Puerto Rico demanding accountability and an end to corruption. After a decade of austerity, hurricanes and earthquakes, Puerto Ricans have a right to a responsive government and full federal support to put an end to this crisis."
"To my mind, the mistake was invading Iraq."
LIVE: Some very powerful special interests tell us the cost of combatting climate change is just too expensive. Compared to what? We're holding a Budget Committee hearing NOW on the cost of inaction on climate change.
"Are you ready for a radical idea? Billionaires in the United States should not be paying less in taxes than nurses, teachers, firefighters and truck drivers.. . It's time to tax the $845 billion in wealth gains 643 billionaires made during the pandemic and expand Medicare to all."
"We cannot keep talking and talking. It's time for Senate Democrats to bring a strong, comprehensive bill to the floor for a vote."
"This is what oligarchy looks like. . . Amazon used its enormous wealth and power to kill a tax to build affordable housing in Seattle. One year later, thousands of people live on the streets, and the city continues to struggle with the crisis."
"The most effective way to keep Americans out of poverty is providing every working-class adult $1,200 and $500 for their kids.. . 75% of Americans want Congress to prioritize these payments in COVID-19 relief—far above everything else. Congressional leadership must listen to them."
"With so many unprecedented crises facing our nation, we must never lose sight of the most existential planetary threat: climate change.. . If we don't get our act together soon, extreme weather disturbances will continue to get more severe. We need a Green New Deal."
"""[The animals] are being taken care of better than we are."" –Larry Howard, a worker at the National Zoo who doesn't know how he is going to pay his bills during Trump's shutdown.. . Mr. President. Your actions have consequences. End your shutdown now and pay federal workers."
"Congratulations to gold-medalist @chloekimsnow, a first-generation American. Her father emigrated from South Korea to America in 1982 and worked his way up to an engineering job which he left to support her ambitions."
Uber and Lyft drivers are struggling as they work for billion-dollar companies. These drivers are not “independent contractors”—they are employees who deserve rights and benefits. I stand in solidarity with them as they strike today for a dignified life.
"How the hell do you run a military on a month-to-month basis? You can't do it! Republicans, do your job, run the damn government."
We had a bit of a debate last night when some of my anti-worker Republican colleagues tried to prevent low-income people from getting additional unemployment support.. . I was not going to allow that to happen.
I sent a letter to my colleagues in the Senate today urging them to oppose this Big Oil side deal.. . The time has come for Congress to tell the fossil fuel industry that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of our planet.
“44 percent of homeless individuals work. They don’t earn enough to get themselves out of their situation so that they can have decent housing.” –@DarrickHamilton #InequalityTownHall
Trump's announced intention to decertify the Iran nuclear agreement would achieve nothing other than isolating the US.
"The horrific rampage in TX once again makes clear that there are some very sick people in this country with guns in their hands who should not have them. Congress may not be able to end this problem, but we must at least pass commonsense gun reforms to finally protect the public."
"Tune in to CNN tonight at 9 ET, when @SenatorCantwell and I will debate @SenTedCruz and @SenatorTimScott on the Republican ""tax reform” plan. #CNNDebateNight"
This legislation will aggressively reduce childhood poverty by extending the Child Tax Credit to deliver direct monthly payments of up to $300 per child to working families.
"Americans don't know what's in the Build Back Better plan because the corporate media doesn't discuss it. Let's stop the beltway gossip and start talking about lowering prescription drug costs, expanding Medicare, childcare and housing – and combatting climate change."
"He promised to lower the cost of prescription drugs but then nominated Alex Azar, a former pharmaceutical industry executive, as head of the Health and Human Services agency."
"No. We cannot allow Medicare to increase premiums on 57 million senior citizens because Biogen wants to charge $56,000 for an Alzheimer's drug that independent experts say should cost between $3,000-$8,400."
"We are not going to let Social Security be destroyed. Today, 18 senators and 140 House members are founding the Expand Social Security Caucus to make sure seniors can retire in dignity.. . Hear that, Paul Ryan?"
"I'm proud of initiatives I fought for in the budget agreement that increase funding for child care, the Social Security Administration, Veterans Administration, community health centers, student debt relief, our crumbling infrastructure, the opioid epidemic and disaster recovery."
A Native American health center asked for medical supplies and got body bags instead.. . Is this what America is about?. . Native communities are in crisis with totally inadequate federal support. We must prioritize real tribal health care and economic aid.
"How is it that there is always money for war but never enough money for the children, the sick, the hungry, and the poor?"
"The bigotry of the Trump administration is shameful. Our job must be to stand with the transgender community, repeal this hateful policy, and fight against discrimination wherever it appears."
I find it reprehensible that Amazon is firing employees who speak out against unsafe working conditions during this horrific pandemic.. . These workers will not be silenced.
"CEOS VS WORKERS TOWN HALL: Watch live as Sen. Sanders and workers from Amazon, Disney, McDonald’s, American Airlines and Walmart address the the wealth of corporate executives and the wages and treatment of the companies’ workers."
Sen. Joe Manchin should explain to the people of West Virginia why he doesn’t have the courage to stand up to special interests.
"Barbara Bush will be remembered as a strong, independently minded and popular First Lady who was devoted to her family and her country. Jane and I send our condolences to the Bush family."
The entire island of Puerto Rico lost power and 60% of households still don't have clean running water. The full resources of the U.S. government must be brought to bear to address the suffering of our fellow citizens.
"When politicians say that climate change is not real, it’s not just that they’re lying.. . It’s not just that they’re rejecting science.. . They are turning their backs on the people of Louisiana, who are dealing with the catastrophic impacts of climate change today."
"You know what? Maybe, just maybe, the rich should pay their fair share of taxes."
Judge Kavanaugh is not worthy of joining the Supreme Court.. . - He will become a part of the hard-right majority on the Supreme Court. - There are very credible allegations of sexual assault against him. - He lied to Congress
"One out of every five children in America lives in poverty.. . This year alone, the richest 172 billionaires in America added half a trillion dollars to their fortunes.. . Billionaires stepping over children sleeping on the street is not what this country is supposed to be about."
What motivates some of these people is greed and greed and more greed. It is like a sickness. It is like an addiction.
"How is it that we have trillions of dollars to spend on endless wars, but we don’t have the money to address the needs of the working class?. . How is it that we have money for tax breaks for billionaires, but not enough to invest in American families? . . Give me a break."
"To restore our one-person-one-vote democracy, we must pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United and stop this country's slide to oligarchy."
"The Alabama Senate voted to outlaw nearly all abortions. These hypocrites decry ""big government,"" yet they want to control every aspect of women's bodies, private decisions, and futures..  . Our job is to fight at every step to protect reproductive rights."
"I'm LIVE now, speaking on the floor of the U.S. Senate.. . In every state in America, people are hurting and calling out for help. Let us hear their cries.. . Let us act now to end police brutality, halt a deadly pandemic, and provide economic relief to all."
"Kavanaugh claimed he didn't drink on weeknights but an entry on his calendar for Thursday July 1 states, “Go to Timmy’s for Skis w/ Judge, Tom, Pj, Bernie, Squi.” Kavanaugh clarified to Sen. Booker that “Skis” referred to beer. Was Kavanaugh's original statement truthful? (10/10)"
In a few minutes I'll be taking your questions about the government shutdown. Watch on Facebook Live:
"We must end U.S. support for the unauthorized, unconstitutional, and disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen. The suffering people there do not need more bombs. They need more jobs, food and health care."
"4 million coronavirus cases. Over 140,000 deaths.. . As other countries’ infections decline, America's are surging.. . Trump's incompetence is literally killing Americans."
"Last year, the five largest drug companies in America made nearly $60 billion in profits. The top five pharma CEOs made over $113 million in total compensation in 2017.. . Meanwhile, 1 in 5 Americans can’t afford their prescriptions. That should outrage every member of Congress."
"How the hell are you supposed to wash your hands during a pandemic when your water has been shut off?. . We must require utility companies to restore services to all who have been disconnected, and prohibit all new shutoffs until this crisis is over."
"I’m having déjà vu as some in Congress repeat the same arguments used to pass the disastrous NAFTA agreement in 1992 to pass Trump’s NAFTA 2.0 today. . . Sorry, but the American people won't allow any trade deal to go through that outsources good American jobs this time around."
"Congratulations to the Burlington High School women's soccer team on taking this courageous step. I myself am a baseball fan, but no matter the sport, I hope all fans and athletes can agree on this: Equal pay for equal work, full stop."
"Over the last decade, workers’ wages barely kept up with inflation, while the number of billionaires in the United States more than doubled. The top 1% owns more wealth now than before the 2008 financial crash. . . This is what a rigged economy looks like:"
"The 20 biggest fossil fuel companies are responsible for more than one-third of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions in the modern era, while raking in massive profits."
It is not a radical idea to say that every American citizen over the age of 18 should be automatically registered to vote.
Congress must not break for recess unless it addresses some of the major crises facing this country.
Failure is not an option. We are running out of time. The United States must lead the world in reducing carbon emissions and bring countries together to secure global action to avert climate catastrophe.
"The federal minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage. That is why I, along with many other members of Congress, will introduce legislation this week to raise that wage to $15 an hour. If you work 40 hours a week, you should not live in poverty."
"Amazingly, Trump is waging war against a group that didn't exist when the authorization of military force passed."
"College athletes are workers. They deserve pay, a union, and to own their own name, image, and likeness. We cannot wait for the NCAA to share its billions with the workers who create it. It is long past time we gave these workers the rights they deserve."
"The American people are sick and tired of a president who is a liar, a fraud, a narcissist and a bully, @realDonaldTrump. They want leadership which unites us, not divides us."
The U.S.-funded Organization of American States falsely claimed that last year's elections in Bolivia were “fraudulent.” A military coup and repression followed..  . We need real accountability NOW to ensure free and fair elections in Bolivia next month.
One of the great crises facing our democracy is the power of the billionaire class over our political process. The needs of ordinary people are ignored as the rich and their Super PACs buy elections.
We cannot spend more on our military than the next 10 nations combined while millions of Americans do not have food and housing and health care. It’s about time we got our national priorities right. That is why I voted against spending $716 billion on the military today.
Climate change is the existential crisis of our time. Why isn't this something we talk about on the news every day?
"For too long, our government has worked only for the 1%. Sen. Mitch McConnell and his Republican friends want to keep it that way. Too bad. We are going to put the needs of working people first."
"At the end of the day, it is not necessarily true that building more guns, tanks, and missiles is the only way we will be safe.. . We will be safer when people around the world get to know each other and understand the humanity they have in common."
What does it feel like to be threatened with deportation?
I urge Catalyst Pharmaceuticals to respond to this FDA decision by lowering its own outrageous prices. No patient should worry about whether they will suffer or die just to increase the obscene profits of a pharmaceutical company.
"Combined 2018 profit of Amazon, GM, Netflix & Goodyear: $24.5 billion. . Federal income taxes paid: $0. . Combined federal tax refund: $275 million. . Our job: Repeal all of the Trump tax giveaways to the top 1 percent and large corporations and rebuild the disappearing middle class."
"Billionaires shouldn't be on welfare. If the owners of large, profitable corporations won't pay workers a living wage, then we are going to tax them for 100% of the public assistance benefits their workers are forced to rely on."
"Millions of Americans don't know how they're going to pay for groceries, rent, utilities, or medicine.. . Our legislation with @SenKamalaHarris and @SenMarkey provides every working family with $2,000 a month, per person, until this crisis is over:"
Does Congress have the guts to take on the drug companies who are spending over $300 million in lobbying? Do we have the guts to take on the insurance companies who don't want us to expand Medicare? Do we have the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry to save the planet?
Let's not confuse our campaigns @SenTedCruz. Mine had an average contribution of $27. You received $38 million from three billionaires.
"Monopolies are harming the livelihoods of rural Americans. A handful of companies dominate the markets for seeds, equipment, meat packing, and patents. We need to put an end to corporate mergers and break up Big Ag so family farmers can get a fair shake."
"I stand with GE’s workers who are calling on the company to convert its factories to produce ventilators..  . No more layoffs, outsourcing, and tax dodging, @generalelectric. Put Americans to work manufacturing the life-saving ventilators we need."
"We must make it easier to vote—not harder. No one should be forced to wait in line for hours to participate in our elections. . . Our job is to fight racist voter suppression everywhere, restore the Voting Rights Act, and create a vibrant democracy."
"The end of #NetNeutrality would be a disaster for our country, for small businesses and for the free flow of ideas. My colleagues and I are forcing a vote to overturn the FCC's decision to repeal net neutrality. This fight is not over."
"The business model of the pharmaceutical industry is fraud. We pay the highest prices on Earth for prescription drugs because of collusion & price fixing. Purdue went a step further. Despite knowing OxyContin was addictive, it actively pushed it— killing thousands. Outrageous!"
"I will be damned if the federal government outsources more good-paying jobs in the middle of an economic meltdown..  . We must not allow the Trump Administration to exploit this crisis and attack unions, slash wages, or destroy middle-class jobs."
"Time and time again, large technology corporations are trampling on the rights of consumers with impunity. The job of the Federal Trade Commission is to regulate industry and defend the public interest. The FTC must get its act together."
"Trump is right that the opioid crisis is a national emergency. Unfortunately, his announcement today was nothing more than an empty promise."
We are the only major country not to make health care a right. Watch our Medicare for All National Town Hall tonight at 7 ET to learn how we can end that international embarrassment:
Days of paid leave offered to new moms: . . 🇮🇪: 182. 🇮🇹: 152. 🇨🇦: 119. 🇫🇷: 112. 🇯🇵: 98. 🇸🇪: 90. 🇲🇽: 84. 🇺🇸: 0. . Absurd. The time is now to finally guarantee paid family and medical leave in this country.
"No, President Trump, the economy is not “absolutely booming” when nearly 80 percent of workers live paycheck to paycheck. Instead of an agenda for the wealthy few, we need to create an economy that works for all of us."
Do not tell me that addressing the existential threat of climate change is radical. Failing to save the planet from climate disasters is radical.
"In the French elections, given the choice between progressives who want to increase taxes on the rich, or right-wing extremists who are viciously anti-immigrant, the pro-business ""centrist"" party of Macron just couldn't make a choice. There's a lesson to be learned here."
The American people are fighting to defend USPS and our democracy from Trump and his crony Postmaster General DeJoy. . . DeJoy must answer for his disturbing financial conflicts of interest and attempt to sabotage USPS. And we must pass legislation to fully fund and protect USPS.
It gives me no pleasure to tell you what you already know: Trump lies all of the time and his speech last night was no exception.
We will provide universal pre-kindergarten to every 3-and-4-year-old. . . We will begin to address the crisis in higher education by making community colleges in America tuition-free.
"Tomorrow, I'm introducing the Medicare for All Act of 2019.. . -70% of Americans support it. -More than a dozen Senate co-sponsors. -Endorsed by more than 50 nat'l orgs. -Covers long-term services, ensuring care for people with disabilities. . Health care is a RIGHT, not a privilege."
"The good news is that we have the technology to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels. . . The bad news is that Congress and the White House lack the political will to stand up to the fossil fuel industry. Together, you and I will change that."
"The people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are not forgotten, they are not alone, and we will do everything possible to rebuild those beautiful islands."
"In the midst of a pandemic, an economic meltdown, systemic racism and climate change, Republicans and Democrats want to pass a record-breaking $740 billion military budget.. . My amendment cuts military spending by 10% and uses the savings to help the poor."
How can a president not talk about the inadequate funding and staffing at the Social Security Administration which has resulted in thousands of people with disabilities dying because they did not get their claims processed in time? #BernieResponds
"No, Attorney General Sessions. Marijuana is not the same as heroin. No one who has seriously studied the issue believes that. Quite the contrary. We should allow states the right to move toward the decriminalization of marijuana, not reverse the progress that has been made."
"☀️Solar—¢4.3/kWh. 💨Wind—¢4.2/kWh. 🛢Coal—¢10/kWh. ☢️Nuclear—¢15/kWh.  . As renewable costs fall, there is no technological obstacle to transforming our energy system to create millions of good jobs. What we need now is the political will for a Green New Deal."
Workers have a constitutional right to form a union and negotiate for better wages and working conditions. But what we are seeing all over the country is profitable corporations like Delta doing everything they can to prevent that.
President Trump's immoral budget will cut Social Security benefits for millions of hardworking Americans. And that means he lied to the American people.
"During his campaign, Trump said over and over again that he would stick it to the wealthy by closing the egregious carried interest loophole. Guess what? His disgraceful tax bill did nothing to address it and even Fox Business commentators are fed up with his broken promises."
"It is crazy that we are the only country that lets drug companies charge anything they want—even $6 million—and raise the price tomorrow.. . Taxpayers give Big Pharma patent monopolies, tax breaks and research money. But Medicare isn't allowed to negotiate fair prices. Shameful."
"There’s a reason why all past US administrations have not made this move, and why leaders around the world have warned Trump against it: It would undermine the prospects for an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement and severely, perhaps irreparably, damage our ability to broker it."
"According to the Tax Policy Center, 87 million middle class households would see their taxes go up by the end of the decade under the Republican tax bill. #CNNDebateNight"
"In the richest country, everyone who has the desire and ability should be able to get a college education."
The Trump Administration's failure to require everybody to wear masks in airports and airplanes will only lead to more sickness and death.. . Flight attendants and airline workers should not be forced to put their lives and health at risk. Enough is enough.
"Republicans are already using the huge increase in the debt that they caused as an excuse to make major cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. That is unacceptable."
"Tonight, more than 500,000 Americans will sleep in the streets.. . This year, 80% of all new rentals will be luxury apartments..  . That is immoral. We will make the top 1% pay their fair share of taxes and make housing a human right. The ultra-rich can no longer have it all."
"The expansion of Medicare to cover dental, hearing and vision is one of the most popular and important provisions in the entire reconciliation bill. It’s what the American people want. It’s not coming out."
"I want wish each and every one of you a very happy May Day. When working people in our country and around the world come together, there is nothing that can stop us in the struggle for justice."
"Congratulations to the advocates fighting the Keystone XL pipeline!. . If we believe a clean environment and indigenous rights matter more than Big Oil’s short-term profits, then rejecting this disastrous project is a no-brainer."
"""We should be able to agree that we will not keep kids in child internment camps indefinitely and hidden away from public view."" – @RepCummings"
One way to destroy Social Security is to underfund and understaff the Social Security Administration. That is what Republicans have been doing. I am glad to have helped lead the effort to reverse that situation. It's a start.
Mike was a very decent human being. He will be missed. Jane and I send our condolences to the Enzi family.
"The President should lead this country in changing the culture, making it easier for women to come forward and tell their stories, making it clear to boys and men that in this country, that type of behavior is unacceptable. Instead, he mocked a truly courageous woman."
"While working people struggle with high gas prices at the pump, Exxon made $6.8 billion in profits in the last quarter and Chevron made $6.1 billion. We must stop the profiteering and monopolistic behavior of the giant oil companies. American consumers deserve better."
"It is outrageous that, amid a global pandemic, major pharmaceutical companies are lobbying to protect billions in profits. I urge the Biden administration to support the proposal to waive vaccine-related IP rights at the WTO to rapidly expand supplies of vaccines."
".@amazon, if our claims about wages and working conditions at Amazon are inaccurate then prove it. . . Make public the number of people you hire through temporary staffing agencies like Integrity Staffing Solutions and make public the hourly rate and benefits those workers earn."
"The good news is, the ideas that we have been talking about—Medicare for all, making public colleges and universities tuition-free, leaving a healthy planet for our kids and grandkids—are now mainstream ideas supported by the vast majority of the American people."
"It is beyond belief that in 2022, as we face challenges like covid & climate change, any national leader would start a war that could kill thousands & create millions of refugees. There is a diplomatic solution to this crisis. It is tragic that Putin seems intent to reject it."
"It makes no sense for young people to be denied jobs because they were arrested for smoking marijuana. It is time to legalize marijuana, expunge past marijuana convictions and end the failed war on drugs."
"Median Black family wealth: $1,700. Median Latinx family wealth: $2,000. Median White family wealth: $116,800. That is simply unacceptable."
"I find it amusing that Mr. Trump postures as a critic of this country's establishment. He got a $200,000 allowance as a kid, enjoys golfing with the rich and powerful, and gives billions upon billions in tax breaks to the world's largest corporations."
"There will no real social progress in this country unless we have the courage to take on Wall Street, the insurance companies, the drug companies, the military-industrial complex, the fossil fuel industry, the prison industry and all the other forces of greed."

"If there's one thing to learn from this horrible crisis it's this: We must end our dependence on big oil & authoritarian regimes for expensive fossil fuels that are destroying the planet & harming our economy. Now, more than ever, we need a Manhattan Project for renewable energy."
"Jane and I express our condolences to the family of Vermont entrepreneur, Jake Burton. We appreciate his innovations in the sport of snowboarding, and the joy and excitement that he brought to millions throughout the world."
Happy Valentine's day to all the millionaires who will not have to pay into Social Security for the rest of the year. Let's lift the cap and end this absurdity.
"We are not going to let Trump and his cronies sabotage, bankrupt, and privatize the Postal Service.. . We are not going to let them suppress vote by mail and undermine democracy.. . We are going to fight like hell to #SaveTheUSPS."
Politicians who gerrymander districts to unfairly gain political advantages are undermining our democracy. Period.
"Today is #CensusDay, and I urge every person living in the United States to fill it out.. . It is more important than ever that we participate in the Census and make sure funding for things like health care and nutrition support go to everybody who needs it:"
The American people are sick and tired of endless war.. . We must invest in human needs—not waste trillions of dollars on death and destruction.

Canadians are sick and tired of Republicans lying about their health care.
"Mass incarceration—in which we lock up far more people than any other country on Earth—is an inhumane policy which has completely failed. . . We must invest in affordable housing, education and jobs, not more jails and incarceration."

"16 years ago, the United States invaded Iraq. I opposed it at the time, warning of unintended consequences. We are still dealing with those disastrous consequences today and will be for many years. We need a foreign policy that focuses on diplomacy, not war."
"Secretary Pompeo should stop misleading the American people about the Yemen war. The fact is that Iran's role is minimal, and continued U.S. support for this Saudi-led catastrophe undermines our national security."
"We are going to tax Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and the other billionaires' outrageous pandemic wealth accumulation so we can provide health care to all our people."
"We spend much, much more on health care per capita in the United States than any other major country and yet have worse outcomes. #MedicareForAll"
"Trade is a good thing, but it must be fair. Instead of rejoining the TPP, we must fundamentally rewrite our failed trade policies in order to raise living standards for American workers and workers throughout the world."
Common sense suggests that we have got to do everything possible to prevent the conversion of semi-automatic rifles into automatic rifles.
What bill? We still haven't seen what we're voting on.
Now is the time to remove the ridiculous federal prohibition on marijuana. I'm proud to co-sponsor the Marijuana Justice Act.
"I’m proud of my state, Vermont, for leading the nation in considering making free school meals universal for children.. . In the richest country in the history of the world, “lunch debt” for hungry kids trying to learn at school should not exist."
"Ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons. Prohibit high-capacity magazines. Expand background checks. End the gun show loophole. If we can’t get 60 votes in the Senate, then we must end the filibuster."
"Trump could get us into never-ending, perpetual warfare in the Middle East. The Senate must pass my No War Against Iran Act."

The time is long overdue for comprehensive and humane reform of our immigration system. These members of Congress went to the Southern border to go inside detention facilities operated by the Trump administration. What they saw horrified them.
Today in America:. - the two richest people own more wealth than the bottom 40%. - the top 1% owns more wealth than the bottom 92%.  . That level of inequality is immoral and unsustainable.

"The United States can bring unequaled leadership to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but we must use that leadership to promote a just and durable agreement. Any acceptable peace deal must be consistent with international law and multiple UN resolutions."
LGBTQ people face unacceptable workplace discrimination and abuse. I say to the huge corporations rainbow-branding themselves for #PrideMonth:. . Pay your employees fairly.. Let them unionize.. Support their right to health care.. . Do not cheapen the struggle for dignity and freedom.

"I stand with the people of Puerto Rico, who have taken to the streets for a national strike, to demand the immediate resignation of Governor Rosselló. We must ensure the full support of the federal government in the rebuilding and recovery of Puerto Rico."
Betsy DeVos will go down in history as the worst Education Secretary to ever hold that office.
"Nearly half a century ago, the Supreme Court affirmed abortion as a constitutional right.. . I am sick and tired of conservatives who say, ""Get government off our backs,"" while telling women what they can do with their bodies.. . Women get to control their bodies—not politicians."
"We need leadership at the FDA that is finally willing to stand up to the greed and power of the pharmaceutical industry. In this critical moment, Dr. Califf is not the leader Americans need at the agency and I will oppose his nomination."
"The insurance industry is mounting a multi-million dollar campaign against Medicare for All. They want you to believe that the Canadian health care system that guarantees health care to every man, woman and child in that country is a disaster.. . They are dead wrong."
Let me be clear: Every American must be able to retire with dignity. Period..  . Join me Tomorrow at 11 a.m. ET for a hearing in the Senate Budget Committee to discuss how we must save and expand Social Security – not cut it.
It’s time for the American people to understand which side their senators are on. No more excuses. No more delays. It’s time for the U.S. Senate to vote.
We must support Ukraine’s democracy while working toward a realistic resolution that will prevent a devastating war.
Rep. Ocasio-Cortez is right. The big banks prey on poor people with high interest rates or ignore them entirely. . . The vast majority of postal services around the world allow their customers to use basic banking services without outrageous fees and interest rates. So should we.
We need one more Republican senator who has the decency to stand up to the telecom and cable industries and protect the American people. Let's find them.
"Over and over, Trump falsely claimed that his $1.5 trillion tax cut bill would pay for itself. Today’s CBO report puts that myth to rest. Trump’s massive tax break for the wealthy and large corporations is the primary reason that the federal deficit will explode."
Every major health organization in this country thinks the Republican plan is a bad idea. #HealthCareDebate
"It is unfortunate that Trump officials have to resign in order to shed light on the huge debt burden for students. We must cancel student loan debt—but not just some of it. All $1,675,469,158,747."
"We cannot allow public schools to be closed, privatized and turned into charter schools that care more about profit than educating Puerto Rico’s students."
"A U.S. airstrike was intended for ISIS, but killed 30 Afghan civilians. This is just one of the horrors of endless war. ISIS did not even exist when America invaded Afghanistan 18 years ago..  . We need to end our longest war and bring our troops home."
"In order to effectively combat the rise of the international authoritarian axis, we need an international progressive movement that mobilizes behind a vision of shared prosperity, security and dignity for all people."
"“They’re using us as a bargaining chip.”. “I feel as, I think many people do, a bit like a pawn.”. “Holding federal employees hostage is not the way to do it.”. . President Trump, listen to federal workers. End the shutdown!"
"Nicole Smith-Holt’s son Alec died at 26 because he was rationing insulin that was too expensive. Every day, Americans are suffering and dying because of the greed of Big Pharma. We need to share these stories and stand together to fight back."
Let me say this to all the survivors out there: I hear you. I believe you. Thank you for speaking out.
"Renewable energy, like wind and solar, are the kinds of projects the federal government should be focused on—not more drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. #ProtectTheArctic"
"Through our efforts to make prescription drugs affordable and expand dental care, I saw how committed he was to a more compassionate, humane society. He will be sorely missed. Our thoughts are with his family today."
"Workers of all backgrounds are standing up for their rights. That includes yoga teachers, who are facing down shameful anti-union propaganda from their Wall Street owners. This is exactly the kind of energy we need to rebuild the middle class."
This teacher is one of many millions of Americans saddled with insurmountable student debt. It’s time to make college tuition free in America.
"There already is far too much media concentration in this country. We need more diversity, more local ownership, more viewpoints. @AjitPaiFCC's decision is a massive step backwards."
The people of Puerto Rico are suffering. We must act immediately to address this humanitarian crisis.
We should not be selling assault weapons in this country. These weapons are not for hunting. They are for killing human beings. These are military weapons.
Today we remember the unspeakable tragedy that stole the lives of 20 children and 6 educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. We cannot continue to allow sickening and senseless gun violence in this country. The time for Congress to act is long overdue.
"The billionaires in the Trump administration should tell that to the:. - 140 million Americans struggling to pay for basic living expenses. - The more than 30 million people who have no health insurance . - The seniors trying to live on Social Security benefits of $12,000 a year."
Mike Pompeo is a disastrous choice for secretary of state. His nomination must be defeated.
"Increase in unemployment from February to March:. 🇪🇺 EU: 0.1%. 🇩🇰 Denmark: 0.2%. 🇩🇪 Germany: 0.7%. 🇺🇸 United States: 11.5%. . Newly uninsured people:. 🇪🇺 0. 🇩🇰 0. 🇩🇪 0. 🇺🇸 12,700,000. . Solution: Guarantee paychecks to workers and health care to all."
Thank you to the young people throughout this country who are walking out today and who have the courage to do what the United States Congress is not doing: lead us forward to stop the slaughter that we have seen from coast to coast due to gun violence. #NationalWalkoutDay
Lives are at stake. I’m on my way to vote to override Donald Trump’s veto of our bipartisan resolution to stop U.S. involvement in the Saudi war in Yemen.
"Amount of federal government subsidies given to the fossil fuel industry every year: $15 billion.. . The amount it should be, immediately: $0.. . It's time to end fossil fuel subsidies and enact the Green New Deal."
Next week the House will vote on our resolution to end US support for the Yemen war. I urge my House colleagues to reject any effort to undermine the resolution with a motion to recommit. It’s time to pass this resolution and send it to the president.
No. Congress should not provide a $10 billion handout to Jeff Bezos for space exploration as part of the defense spending bill. Unbelievable.
More than 2 out of 3 Disneyland workers say they go hungry. That does not sound like the “happiest place on Earth” to me.
"When faced with allegations of sexual assault, Brett Kavanaugh took a page from Donald Trump's playbook."
"As coronavirus cases rise, nurses are demanding that this for-profit, corporate hospital chain provide them with the protective gear and staffing support they need to care for their patients.. . I stand with the nurses striking across this country today."
"Many public colleges and universities were tuition-free 50 years ago.. . America is now twice as rich.. . I think maybe we can afford to stop punishing our young people with student debt for the ""crime"" of getting an education.. . It's time to make college a right for all."
"The disastrous Citizens United decision lets corporate America spend unlimited sums of money buying the airwaves for elections. It is totally legal, but not what America should be about..  . Millions of ordinary Americans must push back if we want real democracy in this country."
"""To anybody who thinks it’s fine to take away coverage for pre-existing conditions, you need to know that without insurance, I would probably die."" Liz Leavens is one of many people afraid of what might happen if Republicans get rid of protections for pre-existing conditions."
"If Trump were serious about protecting our national security, he would recognize that climate change is not a ""hoax"" and is already causing destruction and instability worldwide. The time for bold action is now."
"I am proud to join @SenatorDurbin on this legislation to have the IMF provide financial support to the developing world, at no cost to U.S. taxpayers.. . It is the very least we can do to prevent unimaginable increases in poverty, hunger, and disease that threaten the world's poor."
"Lloyd Blankfein, the former CEO of Goldman Sachs, is correct that the money from stock buybacks “doesn't vanish.” It increases the wealth of billionaires like him. Instead of making the very rich even richer, how about increasing wages for American workers. Is that a bad idea?"
"This nation needs a serious conversation about the proper role of these companies. Should Facebook, Google and Amazon be allowed to control so much of the internet? How do ordinary citizens benefit from the internet without seeing an invasion of their personal lives?"
Enough is enough. A life-saving prescription drug does not work if you cannot afford to buy it.
It's absolutely unacceptable that Postmaster General DeJoy (a top campaign contributor to Trump) has refused to restore the mail sorting machines he removed in states like Wisconsin and Michigan. This is a clear attempt to slow down the mail and suppress the vote. DeJoy must go.
"Think about all of the intellectual and emotional damage we do because we ignore the needs of our children.. . Under my legislation with @Ilhan, we invest in our young people, we nurture them, and we make sure all of our kids get free school meals."
"The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which over the last two decades spent nearly $1.4 billion on lobbying to stop legislation that meets the needs of the working class, is VERY NERVOUS that the American people are waking up to the reality of corporate greed and growing inequality."
Sen. Van Hollen is absolutely right. We should block consideration of all bills on the Senate floor until we end the Trump shutdown and reopen the federal government.
"The Senate today should not be dealing with a Supreme Court nomination which, absurdly, will be voted upon a few days before the presidential election. What we should be focusing on is a strong stimulus package which protects unemployed workers and their families."
"Today, I asked the CEOs of Walmart and McDonald's a simple question: Why should taxpayers subsidize the starvation wages of their profitable corporations. If they think they can avoid answering this question because they declined to testify at my hearing they are sorely mistaken."
"People are being thrown in jail for being unable to pay their medical bills.. . To my mind, that is outrageous and un-American.. . ""Medical debt"" should not exist."
"I’m proud to stand in solidarity with 1,500 grad workers at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) who are on strike for a living wage. I say to UIC: Sit down at the bargaining table. Negotiate in good faith. Pay your workers a living wage."
"For the first time, the Senate will vote today on ending an unauthorized war. . . 14 million people in Yemen are on the brink of starvation. 85,000 kids have starved to death.. . The U.S. must stop supporting this disastrous Saudi-led war."
"Trump promised not to cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. Then he supported a Republican budget resolution that proposed slashing Medicaid by $1 trillion and cutting Medicare by $500 billion. #BernieResponds"
It is a bit embarrassing that our great country is the only major country on Earth not to guarantee paid family and medical leave. That MUST change.
"Billionaire Wall Street investors think they’re pretty savvy. But their big bet on fossil fuels didn’t pan out: BlackRock lost $90 billion investing in oil and coal over 10 years. . . Maybe after a few billion more in losses, they’ll realize we should act to solve climate change."
Let's get the facts straight: 62% of the benefits in the Senate Republican tax plan go to the top 1% and 40% of the benefits go to the top 0.1% by the end of the decade. #TaxDebate
"How does it happen that SoFI, a student loan re-financing company, could spend $625 million to put its name on the LA Rams football stadium when 45 million Americans are drowning in $1.8 trillion in student debt? Today would be a good day for the President to cancel student debt."
"How is it that in the richest country in the history of the world, we can't afford to pay everyone a living wage? Until we raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, I'm going to keep asking."
"I have the radical idea that Congress should do what the American people want. And what they want is to have Medicare cover not only hearing, but dental and vision as well. I intend to do everything I can to make that happen."
"I want to thank my colleagues and the many people at the grassroots level who helped us pass this historic resolution. Today, 45 years after the passage of the War Powers Act, the U.S. Senate finally used that authority for the first time."
"The bottom line: the American people do not want us to pass tax breaks for billionaires today and they certainly don’t want us to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid."
"In the richest country in the history of the world, no senior should live in poverty and every American should be able to retire in dignity after a lifetime of hard work. Yes, it’s time expand Social Security."
"Unlike Donald Trump, most Americans do not believe that a free press is ""the enemy of the people."" I am delighted that Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were released from a Myanmar prison after 500 days in prison."
"Micro-chip companies shut down their plants in the United States and hired cheap labor abroad. Now, the same companies who sold out the American worker, are in line to get $53 billion in corporate welfare. Does that make any sense to you?"
"Maybe it’s a radical idea, but I believe a job should lift workers out of poverty – not keep them in it."
Yes. We must abolish the death penalty— period.
"Trump promised that his tax giveaway to the wealthy would put an extra $4,000 into the pockets of middle-class families.. . He lied. Bonuses are up $0.02/hr since the GOP tax cuts passed.. . Our job: Repeal Trump’s tax breaks for the wealthy and rebuild the disappearing middle class."
Fox News wants you to believe that Medicare for All will limit your intake of donuts. Here's why they're wrong:
What we are seeing now in the world is the rise of a new authoritarian axis. #SandersSAIS
"Jimmy Carter was right when he said that America is ""an oligarchy, with unlimited political bribery."". . Every day we are sliding further away from democracy into an oligarchic form of government. . . Democracy should be about one person, one vote—not billionaires buying elections."
".@SenTedCruz said he never called Social Security a Ponzi scheme. But Ted, we got it on the damn screen."
"Because the American people spoke up, Trump has changed his policy of tearing children away from their parents and locking them up in detention cages. But the executive order that he issued today goes nowhere near as far as it should go."
"Mr. President, maybe the reason why more Americans emigrated to Norway last year than the other way around is because they have universal health care and a strong social democracy."
3 in 4 Americans—including 58% of Republicans—support requiring mask wearing.. . We have got to make high-quality masks free for everyone in this country.. . It's time to listen to the American people and save lives. Congress must pass our Masks for All Act:
Brazil’s next president should be chosen by the voters of that country and no one else. It’s an important step forward for democracy that Brazil’s military leadership made clear yesterday that they will respect the results of Sunday’s election.
"How pathetic! Republicans who tell us how much they believe in ""freedom"" and ""national security"" are now caving in to a president who sides with former KGB leader Putin, rather than our own intelligence community."
"Today Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, became the richest man in modern history with a net worth over $150 billion. But will he face his own workers at our town hall tonight? Probably not."
"Today, I am proud to introduce the Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act with @RepBarbaraLee and @RepRashida. If corporations can't understand why it's absurd to pay their CEOs more in a year than their workers will earn in a lifetime, then maybe this bill will help them figure it out."
"CEOs of billion-dollar companies say they want to invest in their workers and communities. Good. I have a few ideas for them:. . ✅ Provide a living wage of at least $15 an hour. ✅ Stop union-busting and outsourcing jobs. ✅ Pay your taxes, don't evade them"
"I sent a letter today to the CEO of Kroger with a simple message: the company, which is doing very well, can afford to provide grocery store workers – the true heroes and heroines of this pandemic – good wages, good benefits, safe working conditions and reliable work schedules."
"Tonight, Trump repeated some of the most extreme anti-women attacks coming from the far right. At a time when we see an unprecedented and coordinated attack against a woman’s right to choose, we must fight to make sure that every woman has the right to control her own body. #SOTU"
"It makes zero sense to provide $53 billion in corporate welfare to the microchip industry and give $10 billion to Jeff Bezos so he can go to the moon. . . I know it is a radical concept, but maybe the government might want to work for working class Americans, not the billionaires."
We now know the richest 400 Americans have rigged the system to pay lower taxes than everyone else in the country.. . The question of our time is this: will we tolerate it? Or will we take back our democracy from the oligarchs who run this country?
Shutting out U.S. lawmakers who are standing up for human rights is what we expect from authoritarian regimes—not the government of India. @RepJayapal is right. She must not be excluded for being outspoken about the unacceptable crackdown on Kashmiris and Muslims.
"After the Pearl Harbor attacks, America came together and in three years mobilized for victory in World War II. . . Today, Congress must lead a national mobilization to take on the fossil fuel industry, transform our economy, and defeat a climate emergency."
"You can disagree. You can fight for your ideas. But when we have zero support from Republicans, two Democrats cannot torpedo a bill supported overwhelmingly by the American people. I do not respect that kind of arrogance."
At least Trump is finally telling the truth about his tax bill.
"When Jonas Salk developed the polio vaccine 65 years ago, he understood its tremendous benefit to all of humanity and he refused to patent it.. . Today, we must put human life above corporate profit. Any coronavirus treatment must be made free for everyone."
"At a time when banks have never been more profitable, Congress voted yesterday to give them another massive gift in the form of deregulation. Our job is to break up the largest financial institutions in the country, not reward their greed and recklessness."
"This poll confirms what we already know: Our current health care system is a disaster. At a time when we are the only major country not to guarantee health care as a right, just 12% of Americans believe our health care system is working very well. Yes. We need Medicare for All."
"General Motors made $11 billion last year. Their CEO was paid $22 million, nearly 300 times as much as their median worker.. . The workers who make GM’s success possible deserve health care and good wages. I know which side I'm on."
I agree with Representative Ilhan Omar: The answer to hate is not more hate; it is compassion.
Millions of people around the world are already experiencing the devastating effects of climate change.. . The price of waiting until it is too late to address the climate crisis is far greater than the cost of coming together to combat climate change NOW. We must act.
"Enough is enough. We must abolish the filibuster and pass gun safety legislation NOW. No one in America needs an AR-15. How many more children, mothers and fathers need to be murdered in cold blood before the Senate has the guts to ban assault weapons and take on the NRA?"
"The Walton family of Walmart is the wealthiest family in the country, worth nearly $175 billion. Meanwhile, Walmart pays its workers wages so low that many of them are forced to depend upon public assistance programs."
This is insane. In the United States of America as many as 20% of people incarcerated are behind bars for the crime of being poor. (Featuring @ShaunKing)
"In Georgia, in order to try to win the election, cowardly Republicans are blatantly suppressing the vote and denying many African Americans the right to vote. Every American, no matter their political view, must vigorously protest this outrageous action."
"Of all the corrupt institutions in America, I haven’t figured out who's worse: Wall Street or the drug companies.. . We must build a movement strong enough to put an end to their greed and control over our government."
"Today in 1922, researchers at the University of Toronto announced the discovery of insulin. They sold the patent for $1 so it would be available to all.. . 97 years later, Eli Lilly is charging ~$300 and Americans die because they can’t afford their medication. Outrageous."
"Are you a student or recent graduate? Apply for a paid internship in Senator Sanders' Burlington and Washington, D.C. offices, including press internships. Applications are due on June 22nd."
I'm proud to celebrate #Juneteenth with @MrDannyGlover. This year's holiday takes on special significance because of today's House hearing on H.R. 40 to study the impacts of slavery. We must come to terms with slavery's horrors and how they affect every aspect of our lives today.
We are with everyone who is being hit by Hurricane Florence. We are one nation and our job is to stand together and help each other out when disasters hit.
"This afternoon, I attended a Senate intelligence briefing where the Trump administration presented its policy on Iran. Without going into specifics, let me just say: If you think the war in Iraq was a disaster, in all likelihood a war with Iran would be far worse."
"Weeks have passed since the House passed legislation to lower prescription drug prices, but Mr. Trump has already promised to veto it..  . He never had the guts to stand up to his billionaire friends and Big Pharma, whose greed is killing Americans."
"The grassroots of our country came together and got the Congress to pass a bipartisan prohibition on unconstitutional war with Iran. Given the recklessness of this administration, I intend to do everything I can in the Senate to get this passed. No war with Iran!"
It also appears that some of Amazon's anti-union efforts may have been in violation of NLRB law. And that is something that the union is addressing with the NLRB right now.
"Student debt disproportionately impacts African Americans and Latinos. 12 years after starting college, the median Black borrower owes more than he or she has taken out in the first place. . . Canceling student debt is an act of racial and economic justice."
"If we make lunch free for all kids, kids do better in school. It’s as simple as that. To ensure that all kids are prepared to be successful, now is the time to make all school meals universal."
"If the minimum wage had kept up with productivity growth since 1968, every worker would make at least $24 an hour.. . Instead, half our workers earn less than $19 an hour today.. . We need a strong trade union movement to reverse corporate America's 50-year war on the working class."
"Lives are at stake. Trump must start taking this national emergency seriously.. . Without delay, we need to use the Defense Production Act to mass produce and distribute urgently needed medical equipment to every state and territory in America."
"The death toll in Yemen's war could grow to 230,000 by the year's end. Trump vetoed our bill to stop U.S. military involvement, but Congress can still prohibit it. And we must..  . I look forward to working with Armed Services Ranking Member Reed to end this humanitarian nightmare."
"I’m LIVE now to make this clear: If all 50 members of the Democratic Caucus were to stand together today, we could pass some very important amendments to profoundly improve the lives of working people and begin to restore faith in our democracy."
Never before in American history have so few owned so much. Maybe the Senate should consider a resolution congratulating the billionaire class for their enormous success transforming our society.
"During his campaign, Trump told the American people he was going to provide health insurance for everybody. Last year, he supported legislation that would have thrown up to 32 million people off of health insurance. #BernieResponds"
We must lower the cost of electricity in Puerto Rico and take advantage of its plentiful solar and wind energy to create sustainable power.
"Jon Donaire Desserts epitomizes the corporate greed that is taking place in this country. I joined @SenAlexPadilla and 5 of our colleagues to stand with striking workers and ask why Bob Rich, who’s worth more than $7 billion, wants to cut back on the needs of struggling workers."
"I was proud to have worked with Rep. Louise Slaughter during my 16 years in the U.S. House of Representatives. Throughout her career, Louise was a leading figure in the fight for economic, social and racial justice. She will be missed by her constituents and the entire country."
"Not all masks are created equal. N95s are far more effective at preventing the spread of COVID-19. I applaud the Biden Administration for making 400 million N95 masks available for free around the country. It is a good first step, and more must be done."
"It is a disgrace that our nurses at the frontlines of this pandemic don't have basic protective gear. If they get sick, what happens to our health system?. . The Department of Labor must issue emergency protection standards for all our health care workers."
Congress must act immediately to fully fund the Community Health Center program. CHCs are vital and irreplaceable.
"""When we try to understand what's causing economic inequality, it's critical to look beyond the politicians and the parties at the actual corporate people who are pulling the strings."" –Professor Gordon Lafer"
"On many issues, we are divided, but comprehensive background checks are supported by 97 percent of Americans. President Trump is a coward whose failure to act threatens public safety."
Bottom line: No one working for the wealthiest person on Earth should have to rely on food stamps. No one working for a man who earns $260 million a day should be forced to sleep in their car. Yet that is what's happening at Amazon. . . My full response:
"The U.S. must lead the way in crushing the coronavirus pandemic everywhere, and I’m pleased the Biden Administration has taken strong action to get more people vaccinated around the world. Everyone, rich or poor, deserves the right to get a life-saving Covid-19 vaccine."
"Yes. Climate change is real. It is already having a devastating impact in the U.S. and around the world, and it will only get worse. That is why any major ""infrastructure"" bill in Congress must include a massive investment in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels."
"We all want a strong defense, but the United States should not be spending $733 billion on the military – more than the next 10 countries combined. We should be investing in education and infrastructure, not endless wars."
"Bring the $2,000 checks up for a vote, Mitch. That's what democracy is about. That's what the American people want."
Millions are losing their jobs and health care at a rate never before seen in American history.. . @realDonaldTrump’s response? Block from enrolling people who desperately need insurance during a pandemic.. . That is insane.
Does single-payer health care mean “government-run” health care? Canadian @docdanielle breaks it down:
"Eight months later, it's clear that Trump's tax cuts are only working for the billionaire class and wealthy CEOs."
This is exactly the kind of future we must fight for. We have 11 short years to come together to massively transition away from fossil fuels to prevent catastrophic climate change. I am proud to co-sponsor the Green New Deal with my good friends @EdMarkey and @AOC.
"Trump said he wanted to get America out of wars. He lied.. . When we passed a bipartisan bill to end illegal support for Saudi airstrikes in Yemen, he vetoed it.. . Trump ignored the Constitution to keep helping this brutal dictatorship as it bombs civilians."
Let's not kid ourselves. What we have today is a campaign finance system that amounts to legalized bribery.
"The Sackler family has made billions of dollars selling opioids. Their greed, which is killing Americans, must end."
"Over the past four days, I have asked—time and again—for a vote on $2,000 payments that Trump, Biden, two-thirds of the House (including 44 Republicans), and 78% of the public support. Tragically, Republican leadership has turned its back on the working families of this country."
It is beyond insane that corporate hospital administrators gave nurses protective gear only after they were tested positive for coronavirus.. . We need emergency labor standards and swift enforcement to protect our frontline medical workers NOW.
"Two years after 49 people were killed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, it is a national tragedy that we have not done a single thing to prevent another mass shooting. We must pass gun safety legislation now. My thoughts are with those who are remembering their loved ones today."
"The greed of opioid manufacturers has taken hundreds of thousands of lives, and the epidemic they created cost us $631 billion over the past four years alone.. . Now they're cutting a deal to pay $18 billion for their wrongdoing. Outrageous."
"A $1,200 check ain't enough. We need $2,000 a month, per person, to make America's working families whole."
One of the great crises facing our democracy is power of the billionaire class over our political process. The needs of ordinary people are ignored when the very rich and their Super PACs buy elections. We need to overturn Citizens United and move to public funding of elections.
Climate change is an existential disaster facing the entire world. We should start acting like it.
I know I speak for all Vermonters in expressing the deep gratitude we feel for the extraordinary role that Sen. Leahy has played in representing Vermont in the U.S. Senate for the last 46 years..  . Jane and I wish him and Marcelle a wonderful and well-earned retirement.
"Federal Income Taxes Paid in 2021:. . $0: AT&T. $0: AIG. $0: Dow. $0: Charter Communications. $0: Salesforce. $0: Duke Energy. $0: Kinder Morgan. . Combined profits: $55.6 billion.  . But we're told inflation is rising because a worker got a 50 cent raise & a $1,400 check. #TaxTheRich"
"LIVE: Join me for a town meeting with Vermont middle and high school students. We will hear from student panelists about the issues that matter most to them, the challenges they face, and how we can address the needs of young people."
This Veteran’s Day let us remember that privatizing the VA would be an insult to the more than 22 million veterans who risked their lives to defend our country. . . To our veterans: I thank you for your service and I stand with you in opposition to privatizing the VA.
"What the data tells us is clear: when government responds to the needs of the working class, millions of families are lifted out of poverty. . . We must not stop here. We must pass the $3.5T reconciliation bill and invest in working families."
"Since my first day in Congress, I've been fighting to raise the minimum wage. Every worker in America should make at least $15 an hour."
"Why does Putin fear Alexei Navalny? Because Navalny exposed Putin’s enormous corruption, and the unimaginable wealth Putin has stolen from the Russian people. That’s why Putin is trying to discredit and silence him. Release Navalny now!"
"This Californian saw the effect of the disastrous wildfires firsthand. If we don't get our act together to boldly address climate change, this is going to be the new normal."
"Congratulations to our neighbors to the north on completing their first year of marijuana legalization! Vermont shares a border with Canada, and as far as I can tell, the sky has not fallen and the cities have not plunged into anarchy on the other side."
"A few years ago, a $15 minimum wage was considered a radical, fringe and unrealistic idea. Not so much anymore. This is what the political revolution is all about."
"Yesterday alone, over 3,000 died from this horrific virus.. . The working class of this country is in the worst financial shape since the Great Depression of the 1930s.. . The American people need help and they need help NOW!"
"A retail worker who misses a shift because of an emergency can be fired on the spot. . . But what happened when Gap's CEO oversaw sales and stock declines? He got a 33% pay raise and made $20 million a year—3,500 times more than his workers. Obscene."
"Climate change is not an issue we can afford to ignore any longer.. . On Monday night I'm hosting a national town hall with @billmckibben, @Ocasio2018, @VanJones68, @shailenewoodley and more on how to tackle this crisis. Tune in:"
"Last night, Senate Republicans passed their disastrous tax bill, but this fight is not over. I’ll be in Dayton, Ohio, shortly to rally the American people against this travesty."
The time is now for the Democratic Party to restore faith with the American people and show them that we are prepared to take on the powerful to address the long neglected needs of the working class.
"The pharmaceutical industry employs nearly 1,500 lobbyists in Washington, DC alone - including the former congressional leaders in both major political parties. Got that? That’s almost three prescription drug lobbyists for every Member of Congress."
"I voted against the Patriot Act. It created an Orwellian system of mass surveillance. We must now end the NSA's unconstitutional data collection on hundreds of millions of calls. Intelligence agencies cannot unjustly surveil activists, Muslim Americans, and people of color."
"Trump’s budget pays for his huge tax break to the top one percent by cutting $1.5 trillion from Medicaid, $845 billion from Medicare and $25 billion from Social Security. That is unacceptable."
"Taxpayers should not subsidize starvation wages paid by the largest and most profitable corporations in America. We must raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. It’s morally right, and good for the economy."
"CEOS VS WORKERS TOWN HALL: Watch live as Sen. Sanders and workers from Amazon, Disney, McDonald’s, American Airlines and Walmart address the the wealth of corporate executives and the wages and treatment of the companies’ workers."
"I simply cannot believe—after 100,000 Americans have lost their lives—that this Trump official refuses to commit to making any effective COVID-19 vaccine free for all. That is obscene."
"Huge tax cuts for multinational corporations and the top 1%, backed by the Koch brothers. @SenWarren and I break down the GOP tax plan."
"Maybe, just maybe, after 18 school shootings in America in just 43 days of 2018 the Congress might want to consider common-sense gun safety legislation and save innocent lives."
"Over 40 years:. . • GDP per person doubled. • CEO pay ⬆️ 1,000%. • CEOs, who got $30 for every $1 a worker made, now get $278. • The median wage grew $2 an hour since 1978. . A political revolution means standing up to billionaires to say: Enough is enough. You can't have it all."
"There will be special guests, good music and great food. Eligible Vermonters can receive a COVID-19 vaccine at the meetings. I look forward to seeing you!. . RSVP:"
"Absentee ballots counted after election day do not ‘flip the results of an election,’ as Justice Kavanaugh claimed. They are the results of the election. Period."
There's no good reason why Americans should feel they have to leave our country in order to receive affordable medical care.
"Does it make sense that we pay the Secretary of Defense $200,000 or less and we give a contractor, who gets 92 percent of his revenue from the taxpayers of this country, $18 million in taxpayer money?"
Workers around the country are fighting for dignity on the job and making history. It is because of them that raising the minimum wage to a living wage is no longer a radical idea. I'm proud to stand with them – always.
"It is time that we, as a nation, come to terms with slavery's horrors and how they affect every aspect of our lives today. I am proud to celebrate #Juneteenth with Mr. Danny Glover."
This is one of the great moral issues of our time. It cannot be kicked down the road any longer. We must pass the DREAM Act now.
"Last week's $740 billion military spending bill wasn't enough. Senate Republicans want $29 billion more for the Pentagon as they try to slash weekly unemployment benefits from $600 to $200 for 30 million Americans who lost their jobs..  . ""Pathetic"" is too mild of a word for this."
"The Walton family is, I think, the poster child for greed."
"How can the Sackler family be proud to say they are multibillionaires while so many children cope with the horrific trauma of having their parents die from opioid addiction?. . This greed—this reckless, uncontrollable greed—is devastating our country."
"Billionaires and huge corporations should not be allowed to use loopholes and tax havens to avoid paying their fair share. At a time of massive global inequality the very wealthy should be paying more in taxes, not less."
"I’m proud to stand in solidarity with @UAW workers at John Deere now on strike who are fighting for decent wages, pensions and retirement health care benefits. They are entitled to be treated with respect and dignity, and I applaud their courage and determination."
"Let me guess. President Trump tonight will talk about crimes committed by undocumented Latinos. Do you think he will mention the mass shootings done by white men, or the need for common sense gun safety legislation?"
Mr. Pompeo: human lives are worth far more than defense contractor profits. We must end America's involvement in this disastrous and unconstitutional war. The Senate must also investigate this effort to mislead us.
"Republicans cannot ask for $54 billion more in military spending, and ignore the health care needs of our children and working families in the CHIP and Community Health Center programs."
Join me and @NYCMayor on The Bernie Sanders Show on Facebook Live at 12:30 ET today. Watch at
LIVE: The recent union victories by @SBWorkersUnited and @amazonlabor tell me that working people all over this country are sick and tired of being exploited by corporations making record-breaking profits. They're prepared to fight for justice and dignity.
What gives me hope right now is this new generation of young people who dream big and do not want to settle for the status quo. #ClimateStrike
Federal Minimum Wage in 2009: $7.25/hr. Federal Minimum Wage in 2020: $7.25/hr. . Total Wealth of U.S. Billionaires in 2009: $1.27 trillion. Total Wealth of U.S. Billionaires in 2020: $3.63 trillion. . Our job: Tax the rich and increase the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour.
"Our extreme poverty rate is so high that it is an international concern. Why on earth are Republicans are trying to push through a $1.5 trillion tax cut for the very wealthiest, while 41 million Americans are living in poverty? This is a disgrace."
"Eid Mubarak to everyone celebrating the end of Ramadan. Jane and I wish you and your loved ones good health, joy and blessings."
I’m LIVE on the floor of the U.S. Senate to stand with rail workers as they fight for paid sick leave and improved working conditions from rail companies that made $20 billion in profits last year.
It’s absurd that the first bill during the shutdown is legislation which punishes Americans who exercise their constitutional right to engage in political activity. Democrats must block consideration of any bills that don’t reopen the government. Let's get our priorities right.
Microsoft will receive $27.7 billion in tax cuts after donating $17.9 million to the Republican Party since 1990.
"We’ve been dealing with Covid-19 for years now. That’s difficult. No way around it. Last week, I spoke with White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator @AshishKJha46 about where we go from here. If you missed it, tune in NOW!"
"Thank you to @RepJayapal and @Ilhan for your bold leadership as co-sponsors of college for all and debt cancellation in the U.S. House.. . To tax Wall Street and stop the student debt crisis, we need a movement. Working together, we will #CancelStudentDebt for 45 million Americans."
"Even before this pandemic, a majority of our workers lived paycheck to paycheck.. . 1 in 7 children didn’t get enough to eat.. . 40% couldn’t afford a $400 emergency.. . Let us learn from this crisis. Let us finally eradicate hunger and poverty in the richest country in human history."
"We must combat oligarchy. A new study shows that the top 10% now own 70% of the wealth, while the bottom half have virtually no net wealth at all. We need an economy that works for all, not just the few."
64% of the American people support creating good-paying jobs by making investments in clean energy and preparing for extreme weather events..  . The question is clear: will we stand with the American people or will Congress protect the interests of the fossil fuel industry?
On Monday Dec. 3 we’re holding a national town hall on addressing the crisis of climate change and creating tens of millions of jobs in the process. I hope you’ll join us.
"Coronavirus has killed more than 85,000 people. Some 36 million workers have lost their jobs. Good thing President Trump is looking out for the real victims of the coronavirus: fossil fuel executives."
"Trump's lies and incompetence have cost us lives.. . America's coronavirus cases are skyrocketing even as other major countries have controlled its spread.. . Congress must step up. We need to act urgently to guarantee robust testing, tracing, masks, and medical treatment for all."
"Our health care system is not only broken for patients, but for residents as well. UVM Medical Center residents need a union, and I am proud to stand with their efforts to unionize."
"Everyone needs to see this to understand the consequences of today's Senate vote to end U.S. support for the war in Yemen.. . 85,000 kids have starved to death.. 14 million Yemenis are on the brink of starvation. . . The Senate must end our involvement in this humanitarian disaster."
"Throughout history, authoritarian leaders have used moments of crisis to seize unchecked power. Hungary’s Orban is the latest example. Now more than ever we must stand up for democracy and rule of law."
"It is an outrage that over 1 million workers who lost jobs during the pandemic haven't received the benefits they earned and deserve. We must make it easier, not harder, for workers to receive these benefits. And, yes, the working class needs $2,000 a month until the crisis ends."
The question is simple: Does Congress have the guts and courage to finally take on the greed of the billionaires and large corporations?
The Supreme Court shamefully chose to protect the profits of the fossil fuel industry today over the future of our planet..  . Our job: Rapidly transition away from fossil fuels like fracked natural gas and create millions of jobs in sustainable energy.
"Instead of providing the kind of wages and benefits that the workers need, Warrior Met has made a totally unsatisfactory offer. Mr. Fink must tell the company’s executives to sit down and negotiate a fair contract now."
"And we need a secretary of state who will address the crisis of climate change, not stymie action on one of the world’s most serious security threats. . . For all these reasons, Mike Pompeo is absolutely the wrong choice to serve as the United States’ top diplomat"
"In 1979, the top one-tenth of 1% owned about 7% of our nation’s wealth. Today they own nearly 23%. #InequalityTownHall"
"I thank my colleagues @SenSherrodBrown, @SenBobCasey, @RonWyden, @SenatorBaldwin, @SenBlumenthal, @SenMarkey, @SenWarren, and @SenJeffMerkley for joining me in this effort to stand with workers and against the outrageous greed of Delta Air Lines."
"Corporate greed is Tyson Foods raising the price of beef by 35% while its owner became $1.6 billion richer during the pandemic, its profits skyrocketed by 140% last quarter to $1.12 billion and its CEO got a 22% raise last year to $14 million. It’s not inflation. It's greed."
This nun has a message for the members of the Trump administration who are using the Bible to justify ripping immigrant children away from their parents.
"Sadly, my Republican colleagues seem to believe our battle against Covid-19 stops at our border. I regret to inform them that’s not how pandemics work. If we want to stop the coronavirus, we must fight it all over the world."
My voting record:. . 1993 NAFTA—NO. 2000 Permanent Normal Trade with China—NO. 2005 DR-CAFTA—NO. 2011 US-Colombia Trade Agreement—NO. 2015 Trans-Pacific Partnership—NO. 2020 USMCA—NO. . Corporate trade killed millions of American jobs. Workers must craft our trade deals—not big business.
STARTING NOW: The #MedicareForAll National Town Hall is live from Washington. It's time to make health care a right.
"This week, we couldn’t get any Senate Republicans to support legislation to guarantee equal pay for equal work. Do we really believe more time and more negotiations will get them to vote for an infrastructure package that truly addresses the crises we face? I don’t think so."
The people want to lower drug costs. Big Pharma wants to stop us. .  . The people want to expand Medicare. The health care industry wants to stop us..  . The people want to combat climate change. The fossil fuel industry wants to stop us..  . It’s time Congress listen to the people.
"I don't often use this phrase, but today, we offered a truly revolutionary proposal to transform and improve our country in many ways. . . All of our people regardless of income deserve the education they need. #CollegeForAll #CancelStudentDebt"
"This is a budget for the military-industrial complex, for corporate CEOs, for Wall Street and for the billionaire class. . . We don’t need billions of dollars for a wall that no one wants. We need a budget that works for all Americans, not just Trump and his billionaire friends."
The American people are demanding that we have the courage to stand up to the NRA and finally take some action to move us in the right direction on gun safety. Let me suggest some of the ways in which I believe we should go forward in a bipartisan way.
"Over a year after Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico is still struggling to recover. It is unconscionable that Trump has allowed our fellow citizens to suffer for so long. To the people of Puerto Rico: you are not forgotten. We will do everything we possibly can to rebuild the island."
"Whether Trump likes it or not, it is Congress, not the president, who determines whether our country goes to war. Congress must not abdicate that responsibility."
"A nation will not survive morally or economically when so few have so much and so many have so little. It is time for CEOs to pay their fair share of taxes, and treat their employees with dignity and respect."
Watch the #ClimateTownHall here with closed captions:
We must demand that the extremely wealthy pay their fair share. Period.
"If you haven't filed your taxes, TODAY is the LAST DAY in 2021 to sign up for the Child Tax Credit. The CTC has lifted more than 3 MILLION kids out of poverty this year alone. Join the millions of working families helping to cut childhood poverty in half."
Are you a student or recent graduate? Apply for a paid internship in my Burlington or DC office. Applications are due on March 16.
"John McCain was an American hero, a man of decency and honor and a friend of mine. He will be missed not just in the U.S. Senate but by all Americans who respect integrity and independence. Jane and I send our deepest condolences to his family."
"Reading the Republican coronavirus bill, you'd think the most important people in America are corporate CEOs. That is wrong.. . Our essential workers include:. 👩‍⚕️Health workers. 🚚Delivery and warehouse workers. 🥗Food workers. 👷‍♀️Transit workers. . We must put their needs ahead of CEOs."
Tomorrow night is going to be a big deal. I hope you'll be a part of it.
"The Trump administration doesn't have a clue about what it is doing, but is creating a very dangerous world scenario. Let us never forget that the Constitution, which some of us actually believe and respect, says Congress has the responsibility for making war, not the President."
You want to talk about what it means to be anti-wealth? Jeff Bezos capturing $133 billion in wealth while paying his workers starvation wages for backbreaking work is anti-wealth.
"Today, the House acted decisively to reverse Trump's efforts to undermine the Postal Service and sabotage the election.. . Now, it is time for the do-nothing Republican Senate to end its vacation and act to save the Post Office and protect working families."
"Why do Americans pay the highest prices for prescription drugs in the world?. . Why are there no restrictions on what a drug company can charge?. . The answer is simple: other than Wall Street, the pharmaceutical industry is the most powerful political force in the country."
Trump’s tax plan takes from the poor and working families in order to give to the very rich. This disastrous proposal must be defeated.
"If we do not pass a Green New Deal, Mr. Trump's resort is likely to be swallowed by sea-level rise before the century ends because of catastrophic climate change.. . Maybe when it is underwater he'll have a harder time calling global warming a ""hoax."""
Making America great is not giving tax cuts to billionaires. It's making sure everyone gets the education they need.
"This pandemic has shown us clearly the vulgarity of our healthcare ""system."" Highest costs in the world, yet not enough nurses or doctors. Many millions uninsured, while insurance company profits soar. The struggle continues. Healthcare is a human right. Medicare for all."
"It's been 8 months since the start of the pandemic. Tens of millions of Americans remain unemployed, uninsured and hungry.. . This is an emergency. The Senate must act now to provide $600 a week to unemployed workers, $2,000-a month to the working class, and expand Medicare to all."
Thank you @NAACP President @DerrickNAACP and @marjInnocent for coming in to discuss community engagement and support for health equity and public schools. I greatly appreciate the work you are doing.
Nearly half of all renters in the U.S. pay more than a third of their income toward rent and utility bills.
"The business model of the pharmaceutical industry:. . 1. Use taxpayer-funded research. 2. Get patent monopolies on treatment. 3. Charge any price they want. . This is a racket that is literally killing people, and it must end.. . Now is not the time for profiteering or price gouging."
"It's a painful day for American democracy that Republicans blocked the creation of a commission to investigate the Jan. 6th insurrection. I applaud the six Republicans who voted for the commission, but I am saddened that so many are too intimidated by Trump to do the right thing."
"This is what a leading Republican thinks of young ""slacker"" Americans who took out loans to go to college."
We must stand up to the drug companies and stop this massive hike in Medicare premiums.
3) The Congress must demand that the sanctions against Russia that were passed last year be fully implemented.
"The Postal Service is:. . 🌎Our only universal delivery network. 👩‍💼Employer of 640,000 Americans. 📦Deliverer of 1.2 billion packages of medicine a year. 🎖Largest provider of jobs for veterans. 🇺🇸Enshrined in the Constitution. . We must save the Postal Service and protect its workers."
"Let's be clear. The legislation passed in Georgia is voter suppression. The Senate must quickly take up the voting rights bills passed by the House of Representatives. If we are serious about calling ourselves a democracy, we must make it easier for people to vote – not harder."
The American people pay higher prices for prescription drugs than people in almost every other major country on Earth..  . Does that make any sense to you?
"Today is the last day to apply for summer internships with Senator Sanders in his Burlington and Washington, DC offices. See here for more information:"
"Medicare for All will lower overall health care costs. Meanwhile:. . 📈Family premiums are up 54%—$20,000 a year. 📈Deductibles up 162%—$1,655 a year. . But I'm sure the American people getting robbed blind by the insurance industry are just thrilled these costs aren't called ""taxes."""
"Since Day One, this president has thought he’s above the law, above criticism, and can get away with anything—including a fake ""emergency"" to sell bombs to Saudi Arabia.. . It is becoming clear he fired an Inspector General for investigating such misconduct."
"Yes, we are going to raise taxes on large, profitable corporations – many that in a given year don’t pay a nickel in federal income tax."
"From disenfranchising ex-felons to extreme gerrymandering, here are the 5 ways the Republican party is trying to suppress the vote. The great political crisis we face is not voter fraud, which barely exists. It is voter suppression and the denial of voting rights."
Trump's tax bill was a scam from the very beginning. We have got to hold Republican leaders accountable for deceiving the American people and giving massive tax breaks to the wealthy and large corporations.
Let’s be clear: 99.8% of Americans would not receive a nickel if Trump repeals the estate tax. But millionaires and billionaires would.
The CBO has demonstrated that increasing the minimum wage would have a direct and substantial impact on the federal budget. What that means is that we can clearly raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour under the rules of budget reconciliation.
"After rescinding the DACA program in September and opposing every piece of legislation to help the Dreamers, Trump blames Democrats for a problem that he created."
"22 Senators just voted for an extreme budget to cut Medicare and Medicaid IN HALF, throwing millions off their health care, while extending Trump's tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy.. . When Republicans tell us who they are and what they want for this country, we should believe them."
"We must stop incarcerating millions of Americans and funding militarism, and end racism in the criminal justice system and in the voting booth. Our attention should be on lifting up all Americans."
"While today’s ruling is a major setback for working families, we must redouble our efforts to make it easier, not harder, to join a union. We cannot rebuild the disappearing middle class without revitalizing the trade union movement."
There are legitimate questions we must ask about the Chinese government’s inability to contain the virus. But Pompeo’s incitement is a blatant effort to distract us from questions about Trump’s own disastrous failure.
I’m for a tax break for small businesses and for working families all over this country. What I am not for is enormous tax breaks for billionaires. #TaxDebate
I say to those who are delaying action on climate change: Look at the blood-red sky and unbreathable air in Australia because of raging forest fires. .  . Our futures are all connected. That is why we must bring the world together and enact a Green New Deal.
"Paul Ryan has been fantasizing about cutting Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security for years. Ryan's plan must be defeated."
Tonight at 10:45 ET: Sen. Sanders responds to Trump's State of the Union address on Facebook and YouTube.
"In the richest country in the history of the world, it is not radical to demand that when people turn on their taps, the water they drink is safe and clean. It has been 5 years since the start of the Flint water crisis. This is absolutely unacceptable."
"The short-term profits of the fossil fuel industry are not more important than the future of our planet. Join me, @350 and other leaders of the climate movement to demand a #FossilFree future."
"If @ChuckGrassley and Senate Republicans are concerned a thorough FBI investigation would delay this confirmation process, remember that you refused to allow the Senate to consider Merrick Garland’s nomination for nearly a year."
It's nice to see Republicans in Congress looking out for the people who really matter: their wealthy donors.
"Cost of having a baby with health insurance today: $4,500. Cost of having a baby under Medicare for All: $0. . We can afford Medicare for All. What we can't afford is continuing to charging families in the U.S. more than any other country for giving birth."
"Our delivery workers are doing some of the most important jobs in the country right now.. . Why the hell aren't they getting the hand sanitizer, protective gear, and paid sick leave they need?. . This should not be happening in the United States of America."
"We are the only major country where millions of people are losing their jobs and health insurance during this pandemic. In my view, the solution is straightforward:. . ✔️ Keep workers on payroll and provide 100% of their wages. ✔️ Treat health care as a right—not an employee benefit"
Because of the lies and greed of Big Oil.
"Elle Purrier St. Pierre, Vermont's most famous dairy farmer, fought her way into the women's Olympic 1,500-meter final! Congratulations,. Elle."
"This week the Senate will be voting on the $2.2 trillion HEROES 2 Act to provide $600 a week to over 25 million unemployed Americans and $1,200 for the working-class.. . At a time when so many Americans are hurting, I hope that my Republican colleagues will vote to pass this bill."
"As Congress moves forward this week on the budget, we must stand with Dreamers. Taking away the legal status of 800,000 young people who were raised in this country and subjecting them to the possibility of deportation would be one of the cruelest acts in modern American history."
How can we talk about problems of crime without mentioning that we have one of the highest rates of childhood poverty in the industrialized world? Building all the jails in the world will not make this right.
This is a simple matter of priorities. With $1.5 trillion we could eliminate child poverty in America two times over. What did Trump and Republicans in Congress choose to do? Give permanent tax breaks to the wealthy and corporations.
"The Trump administration keeps lying. They want to throw 32 million people off insurance, end protections for pre-existing conditions and raise premiums..  . Here's the truth about Medicare for All: It means never having to worry about being able to afford the health care you need."
It's a beautiful day for the #MarchForOurLives in Montpelier. Thank you to the young people who are leading us today.
"It is a moral outrage that during a deadly pandemic, 1 in 7 essential workers are uninsured.. . Congress must empower Medicare to pay all health costs for every person in America during this crisis by passing the Health Care Emergency Guarantee Act."
Enough is enough. Every state in this country has a crumbling infrastructure. Now is the time to put our people back to work by finally addressing the structural problems we face. Let’s get it done.
Remember: we are still the only major country to not guarantee health care to all its people. We've got work to do.
"While Walmart refuses to raise its $11 minimum wage, Alice Walton had no problem purchasing a $500 million private art collection, buying a $25 million 2-floor Park Avenue condo with 52 windows and acquiring a $22 million 4,400-acre Texas ranch. Something is very wrong here."
Mark Zuckerberg testified today about Facebook’s role in our democracy. Here are the most important questions we should ask concerning his testimony:
"Republicans cannot ignore millions of older workers who are about to lose the pensions they were promised, younger people burdened with outrageous levels of student debt or veterans unable to get the quality health care they were promised."
"New Zealand, a small country of 5 million, did something interesting: They listened to scientists. They virtually eliminated COVID-19. Bold and intelligent action saved lives. In our country, tragically, incompetent leadership continues to cost us lives."
"Let me congratulate the Apple Store workers in Oklahoma City for voting to become the 2nd unionized Apple Store in the US. Last year, Apple made a record $95 billion profit. Its billionaire CEO made $99 million in 2021. It's time for Apple to treat its workers with respect."
Our military is larger than these countries combined:. . 🇨🇳 181 billion. 🇸🇦 78 billion. 🇷🇺 61 billion. 🇮🇳 60 billion. 🇬🇧 54 billion. 🇫🇷 52 billion. 🇯🇵 48 billion. 🇩🇪 48 billion. 🇰🇷 39 billion. 🇧🇷 27 billion. 🇮🇹 27 billion. . What if we invested in human needs to care for one another instead?
"When Trump tells us the economy is ""booming,"" please remember:. - Over 40% of Americans don't have enough savings to cover a $400 emergency expense. - 43% can't afford the basics to live. - Over 25% of adults skipped necessary medical care last year because they couldn't afford it"
"It was 115 degrees Fahrenheit in France last week – the highest temperature they have ever recorded..  . Still think climate change is a hoax, @realDonaldTrump? You are delusional."
Right-wing extremists in every state and every branch of government have worked for decades to make it more and more difficult for women to access abortion. We cannot let them win. Abortion is a constitutional right that must be protected.
".@AdyBarkan has been battling terminal ALS, but he's been spending the last year to educate the public on why health care should be a right. He is a true American hero."
The Trump administration’s travel ban was never about keeping America safe. We need only look at Trump’s own words to understand that this has always been a racist and anti-Islamic attempt to ban Muslims from entering this country.
We have a rigged tax code that has essentially legalized tax-dodging for large corporations and the world's wealthiest individuals. It is time to end these egregious loopholes and make the wealthy pay their fair share.
"I don't think you have to be a in infrastructure—a fancy word for roads, bridges, rail and water systems—to know our infrastructure is in quite bad shape.. . Why do we spend trillions on never ending wars but can't afford to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure?"
"Average price of a hearing aid: Over $2,400. . Cost of a set of dentures: Over $2,500. . Cost of prescription eyeglasses: Over $200. . Median income of seniors: About $2,200 a month. . In the richest country on earth, we must expand Medicare to include vision, hearing and dental care."
"If the president is serious about fixing NAFTA, he must protect the interests of American workers—not the CEOs of multi-national corporations who have rigged our trade policies for the past 40 years."
We have strange priorities in the Senate.. . We can’t extend the child tax credit. . . We can’t deal with the crisis in child care. . . We can’t take on climate change. . . But somehow we can provide a massive amount of corporate welfare to a handful of corporations. Totally absurd.
"How insane is this. We tell young people to get the best education they can, and then saddle them for decades with student debt. We must make public colleges and universities tuition-free, and substantially reduce student debt."
"Instead of selling $3 billion in weapons to enrich Raytheon, Boeing and Lockheed, the United States should be partnering with India to fight climate change.. . We can work together to cut air pollution, create good renewable energy jobs, and save our planet."
"If Scotland can demand that Amazon get off corporate welfare and pay its workers a living wage, then so can the United States."
"❌ Gut the Voting Rights Act. ❌ Cut early voting. ❌ Purge voter rolls. ❌ Close polling locations. ❌ Pass restrictive voter ID laws. . When I look at the Republican Party’s efforts to make it harder for people to vote, I have to wonder: Do they truly believe in democracy?"
Trump's tax plan will provide virtually no benefit to truck drivers and result in a tax increase for millions of middle class Americans.
The Founding Fathers were fundamentally opposed to the kind of predatory lenders leeching off student borrowers today.
Racism and white supremacy have no place in Vermont. Kiah Morris was an excellent representative and our state is worse off without her in office. We must root out racism in Vermont and ensure that no one fears for their safety because of the color of their skin.
Here it is! A leading Republican just admitted that they plan to cut Medicare and Social Security to pay for the massive tax cuts they gave billionaires and large corporations.
"""All of veterans, we did not fight for Blue Cross Blue Shield. We fought for the - Denise Rohan, National Commander."
"Mr. President, stop the lying. Last I heard, it was your own budget that cut Social Security and Medicare, not the Democrats."
Here's how we do it:
Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands three years ago today. It is a disgrace that they have not received the full federal resources they need to recover.. . We are the richest country in the world. We must fight to ensure that all our people live with dignity.
"Amazon workers have tested positive for coronavirus—which may live for up to 24 hours on cardboard—at 50 warehouses.. . In my view, failures by Amazon to keep workers safe are not only putting their employees at risk. They place the entire country at risk."
"Sadly, the Republican Party has turned its back on democracy and instead focused on massive voter suppression. We must make it easier for people to vote – not harder."
"Five years ago, could you have believed that half of Americans would agree we need a single-payer health care system? . . When people see the justice of an idea, it spreads like wildfire. The American people know that health care should be a right."
"Despite President Trump's constant support for big polluters, solar energy is making huge advancements.. . Solar power is getting cheaper and cheaper, saving families money on utility bills and creating hundreds of thousands of American jobs."
"This Republican budget was written for the billionaire class, for Wall Street, for corporate CEOs and for the Koch brothers."
"Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo have all seen their tax rates go from 30 to 22 percent thanks to Trump's tax scam. . . Our job: repeal it and tax Wall Street to cancel $1.6 trillion in student debt."
Today we have brought Republicans and Democrats together in a very historic moment to take back the Congress' constitutional responsibility on matters of war.
"Health care is a right, not a privilege. We need Medicare for All so we can end the disgrace of 30 million Americans having no health insurance, and many more being underinsured with high deductibles and co-payments."
"If Brett Kavanaugh refuses to withdraw from consideration for the Supreme Court following these two very serious allegations of sexual assault, then the Senate Judiciary Committee must postpone any votes on his nomination until a full and fair investigation is conducted."
"Just a few months ago, Sen. Graham said he'd like to see a health care bill that the American people actually like. #HealthCareDebate"
"How the hell can corporations going bankrupt and laying off workers still hand out million-dollar bonuses to their CEOs?. . CEOs love this game: Heads, I win. Tails, you lose.. . This is why workers must get a say in their companies and seats on their boards."
"If Republicans could use budget reconciliation to help the wealthy and the powerful, and pass legislation strongly opposed by the American people, we can use that same process to help Americans recover from the worst economic and public health crisis in modern history."
"Enough with the damn lies, @realDonaldTrump. Listen to the scientists. Millions of lives are at stake."
"To understand this war, we must understand what the Palestinian people have been enduring under blockade and occupation. I believe we must stand in solidarity with those Palestinians and Israelis working to build a future of equality and peaceful coexistence."
4) This isn't just Bernie talking. @JeffDSachs found that Medicare for All could save Americans a lot more than the $2 trillion in the Mercatus Center report.
I think it is a little absurd that the United States is the only major country on Earth not to guarantee paid family and medical leave as a right. Don’t you?
"On this day in 1944, Allied forces launched the invasion of Normandy to free Europe from Hitler and fascism. Many brave soldiers died defending democracy. We must not forget their sacrifice. The struggle to protect democracy continues. We must not fail."
It is a disgrace that Republicans are rushing to pass a massive tax break for the wealthy while children are about to be thrown off their health insurance.
"We cannot have an ally who murders a dissident in cold blood, in their own consulate. That is unacceptable by any government, but especially by one so closely aligned with the United States."
This is corruption in plain sight. Remember when Mr. Trump told us that he was going to drain the swamp? What a joke.
"Trump said he would “stop Wall Street from getting away with murder."" Instead, he deregulated Wall Street and gave them a $20 billion tax break. . . I've got a better idea. We're going to make Wall Street pay its fair share and stop reckless speculation."
"At 4:30 PM today, @SenMikeLee @ChrisMurphyCT and I will introduce a joint resolution calling for an end to U.S. support for the Saudi war in Yemen. Tune in:"
LIVE: The American people are sick and tired of our collapsing and dysfunctional health care system. Now is the time for Medicare for All.
Whether it is:. . 🌎 Transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel. ✊ Fighting systemic racism. 🏥 Ending a cruel and dysfunctional healthcare system. 📈 Addressing the grotesque level of wealth inequality in our country. . Now is the time for change—real change.
The brutal murder of Mr. Khashoggi demands that we make clear that United States support for Saudi Arabia is not unconditional.
"Trump said “great nations do not fight endless wars,” and yet he has now vetoed two bipartisan War Powers Resolutions to keep us in those wars.. . Congress must continue its efforts to rein in this lawless president."
Thank you to the American Medical Student Association @AMSANational for endorsing our College for All Act to cancel student debt and make college tuition-free.. . American doctors should not have mountains of debt looming over them while they work to heal the sick and injured.
"It's no secret the @SenateGOP does corporate America's bidding. Well, guess what? Thanks to workers standing up, Amazon and Disney now pay $15 an hour.. . So I'm asking @Senatemajldr McConnell: if huge corporations can raise wages, why can't you? Let us vote on a $15 minimum wage."
97% of Americans support comprehensive background checks. It's time for Republicans in Congress to listen to the American people and stop simply obeying the dictates of the NRA. . . We need to pass common sense gun safety legislation now.
"Donald Trump may not like it, but we are not an authoritarian country. We have a constitution and separation of powers. There is no ""national emergency,"" and Trump cannot build his wall without congressional approval."
"I am once again asking for a yes-or-no vote on $2,000 survival checks."
"The president is lying. He rolled back the Clean Power Plan, which will cause more deaths from air pollution.. . He allowed more coal ash to contaminate our water with mercury and arsenic.. . We must defeat his agenda to protect our health and environment."
"Our economy won't succeed unless we have the best educated workforce in the world. That won't happen if teachers are underpaid and disrespected. Congratulations to the teachers of West Virginia who are standing up for their students, for workers' rights and for a better future."
"Four years ago, @KeithEllison and I rallied with low wage workers for an increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.. . We were laughed at. We were told it was unrealistic. We were told it wouldn't happen. . . Not anymore."
"The labor union movement has led the fight for equal rights and economic and social justice. Today, May Day, we reflect on those struggles, and pledge our support to protecting workers’ rights and building an economy based on human needs, not corporate greed."
Trump's tax plan is an absolute disaster. Here's why:
It is a scandal that we have a president of the United States who does not understand the function of government..  . We should have national policies to deal with this pandemic based on science—not theories retweeted by Trump.
"The national security experts who led this letter are exactly right: Congress must block taxpayer dollars from funding this illegal war. We have a chance to not only end the suffering of Yemenis, but ensure that America is never again embroiled in another unconstitutional war."
"I got involved in politics because I never again want to see humanity descend into the barbarity of the Holocaust.. . On Holocaust Remembrance Day, let us recommit to the struggle we're all involved in to create a world where people love and care for each other."
The United States should not be supporting a catastrophic war led by a despotic regime with a dangerous and irresponsible military policy. . . The Senate must vote to end U.S. support for the unconstitutional Saudi-led war in Yemen.
"No, we should not accept a health care system that allows the pharmaceutical industry to raise the cost of prescription drugs whenever they want to whatever they want. That is barbaric."
"Kavanaugh testified before the committee that he did not believe polygraphs were reliable. In 2016 he wrote, “The Government has satisfactorily explained how polygraph examinations serve law enforcement purposes.” What changed his opinion or was he misleading the committee? (6/x)"
"Eight million people work two or more jobs just to survive in the world's richest country. Their stories show us an economy of, by, and for the 1%.. . It's time to stand up, fight back, and build a society where America's working class can live in dignity."
"After taking a vacation for over a month, Senate Republicans released a ""skinny relief"" bill that provides $0 for working families, $0 for the uninsured, $0 for food, $0 for rent and $0 for mortgages. But they were able to find $740 billion for the Pentagon in July. Disgraceful."
"This crisis makes clear what we have known for decades.. . If we are sincere about the needs of ordinary Americans, we must pass a single-payer national program to guarantee health care for all Americans."
"The Constitution is explicit. It is Congress and only Congress that can authorize American participation in war. That is why @SenMikeLee, @ChrisMurphyCT and I introduced a resolution that would end U.S. intervention in the Saudi led war in Yemen unless Congress authorizes it."
"Average hourly wages for American workers have remained nearly flat since 1960, while home prices have almost TRIPLED over the same time period. It's no wonder that nearly half of all Americans today spend at least 30% of their income on housing. Obscene."
"Today, I stood with a majority of my Senate colleagues who voted to uphold the rule of law. The Constitution and the War Powers Act are perfectly clear: President Trump cannot go to war with Iran without congressional authorization."
This is the wealthiest country in the history of the world. And yet over 40 million Americans are living in poverty and we now have the highest childhood poverty rate of nearly any major country on Earth. #InequalityTownHall
"What the Senate did today is say that the United States Congress is sick and tired of abdicating its constitutional responsibility on matters of war.. . We will not continue to have our military posture dictated by a despotic, murderous regime in Saudi Arabia."
"As part of the Reconciliation Bill, Americans want to lower prescription drug costs (88%) and expand Medicare to cover dental, vision and hearing (84%). Both proposals are strongly opposed by drug companies and private insurance. The Dems must stand with the people, not fold."
"There will be no real progress in this country unless we have the courage to take on Wall Street, the insurance companies, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry, and all the other forces of greed."
I’m voting NO on the $778 billion defense spending bill. I’m LIVE now on the floor of the Senate explaining why.
We need a health care system where people who are sick do not put off going to the doctor because they cannot afford it. #MedicareForAll
"The richest 1% of America's families took in 48% of all income growth over the last 25 years.. . We must reverse this obscene inequality. We need:. . ✅Fair trade, not corporate trade. ✅$15 minimum wage. ✅Strong unions and worker ownership. ✅Taxes—not handouts—for huge corporations"
"""The theme behind this bill is to get middle-class tax relief."" –Mitch McConnell . . ""The entire purpose of this is to lower middle class taxes."" –Paul Ryan. . ""Primarily, and priority number 1, is middle-class Americans."" –Sarah Huckabee Sanders"
"As President, Lula did incredible work to lower poverty in Brazil and to stand up for workers. It is great news that his highly suspect conviction has been annulled. This is an important victory for democracy and justice in Brazil."
"The coronavirus crisis is on a scale of a major war. We need:. . 🏥Testing and health care for all. 💵Direct economic aid to every worker. 🏡No evictions, foreclosures or utility shutoffs.  production of medical supplies. . Now is the time for solidarity. We are in this together."
"Pharma is spending millions to defeat a very modest drug pricing bill. Intel is spending millions to get a $20 billion handout. Joe Manchin, who is blocking climate action, is the major recipient of fossil fuel campaign contributions. This is how a corrupt political system works."
"Somebody told me that West Virginia, Oklahoma and Kentucky are ""red"" states. They got that wrong. These are the states where teachers are now leading the nation in the fight for workers' rights and adequate funding for education. Thank you teachers!"
"Please remember that our ideas, including Medicare for all, are not radical. They are what the vast majority of the American people want."
American workers should not be forced into a race to the bottom. They should not have to compete against manufacturing workers in Vietnam who make as little as 72 cents an hour.
"Today, I went to the the National Archives, where our Constitution is housed, to say to @realDonaldTrump: You are not a dictator and you must obey the Constitution."
Exxon Mobil is getting a great return on their investment in the Republican Party. It will receive a $10.5 billion tax break after donating $16.8 million to Republicans since 1990.
"Today, Memorial Day, we honor the brave men and women who gave their lives to defend our country. Their sacrifices will never be forgotten."
"The Trump administration is threatening a disastrous military intervention in Venezuela. Under our Constitution, only Congress can authorize the use of force. We must make sure the United States does not get involved in yet another war and destabilize another region."
"We must do more than just “honor and remember” Dr. King. We must be faithful to his revolutionary spirit, his call for a “radical revolution of values” and his incredible courage in taking on virtually the entire political and economic establishment of his time. #MLKDay"
"Germany, Canada, France and the UK ensure that workers receive paychecks and benefits during this crisis.. . It is not radical to expect that we join the rest of the advanced world and end the absurdity of millions of Americans losing their jobs every week."
"It is clear now more than ever: Addressing climate change and energy independence is not just an environmental issue, it is a matter of national security. That’s why @RepCori, @RepJasonCrow and I are introducing the Energy Security and Independence Act."
"What we are trying to do, right now, is transformative."
"The wealth gap between white Americans and African Americans has more than TRIPLED over the past 50 years.. . Today, the median white family has almost 10 times as much wealth as the median black family.. . We must fight for racial and economic justice for all."
"I noticed, and I'm pretty damn sure patients with breast cancer and their families will notice too."
"While Trump and his billionaire friends play golf in Florida, low-income Americans and people with disabilities across this country are struggling to stay warm."
"In 1970, 30-year-olds had a 92% chance of earning more than their parents did at the same age.. . By 2010, income per person doubled. But 30-year-olds only had a 50% shot at doing better than their parents.. . We cannot afford more decades of decline. We must transform our economy."
Looking for a paid internship with Senator Sanders? Are you a student or recent graduate? Apply to be a full-time intern in my D.C. office.
Let us stop the voter suppression and allow people to fully participate in our democracy.
"The IPCC is telling us what every sane person knows. Unless there is BOLD action to combat climate change, the planet we will be leaving our kids and future generations will be increasingly uninhabitable. Now is the time for action."
"Today, over 40 million Americans live in poverty - including millions of children and seniors. As we enter the holiday season, and think about the future of our country, let us not forget the biblical admonishment: ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."""
"As every member of the Senate knows, the rules around here get changed all the time. If we can change the rules to prevent a default on our national debt, if we can change the rules to confirm Supreme Court justices, we can certainly change the rules to save American democracy."
"Jeff Bezo’s newly renovated home in Washington DC will have 25 bathrooms. Meanwhile, Amazon workers skip bathroom breaks in order to meet their grueling work targets. #CEOsvsWorkers"
"If Wall Street really believed in defending our democracy, they would commit to never making another campaign donation—period."
In the first week of the new Congress I will be re-introducing my legislation to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 an hour. We have got to end starvation wages in the richest country in the world.
"If we think big, not small, we can end the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality, guarantee health care for all, have a livable minimum wage and make public colleges and universities tuition-free. The struggle continues."
"I said it in 1992 and not much seems to have changed. By and large, the Congress is owned by big money interests and the largest corporations in America."
"Donald Trump Lies, Episode 5,541: Prescription Drugs"
"Israel's annexation of occupied territory would be a disaster for international law, self-determination, freedom and equality.. . I stand with @AOC and House progressives. We cannot allow U.S. tax dollars to be used to violate Palestinians' human rights."
This is what oligarchy is all about. This is why we need to overturn the terrible Citizens United Supreme Court decision and move to public funding of elections.
Average Price of a Gallon of Gas:. U.S.: $4.84. France: $8.11. Germany: $7.46. South Korea: $6.33. South Africa: $5.61. India: $4.99. . The skyrocketing price of gas is not just an American problem. The greed of Big Oil CEOs is an international problem. We need a windfall profits tax.
"This is what corporate welfare is all about: The taxpayers fund the research, Gilead will make huge profits, and consumers will pay outrageous prices.. . Drug companies cannot charge any price they want. These prices must be negotiated with the government."
No parent should have to send their sick child to school because she or he can't take a day from work. We need paid family leave in this country—during this pandemic and after it ends.
Combating climate change is more important than fossil fuel profits. I will not vote for any bill that makes it easier for Big Oil to destroy the planet and that includes approving the Mountain Valley Pipeline. The Continuing Resolution must not be held hostage by Big Oil.
"I've got a message for all the billionaire CEOs out there:.  . If you love America, then you love the workers of this country. And if you love American workers, you pay them a fair wage with decent benefits. You treat them with the dignity that they deserve. Period."
"I applaud Vermont's lawmakers, grassroots organizers, working families and progressive businesses, who came together to override this outrageous veto and give 40,000 Vermonters a raise.. . This is the energy we need to guarantee that every worker in America earns a living wage."
"Phil Hoff was one of the great governors in Vermont history and a leading progressive of his era. History will remember him as a man of great courage who not only helped transform Vermont but was years ahead of his time in the fight for economic, social and racial justice."
Is demanding that the wealthiest people in the country and the largest corporations finally pay their fair share of taxes radical? No. What’s radical is the very rich not paying a nickel in federal income tax while the needs of the working class of this country are neglected.
Trump's Pentagon is run by a former Raytheon lobbyist. So of course an official who successfully eliminated billions in Pentagon waste and abuse was forced out. . . It's time to slash our bloated military budget and use the savings to solve real human needs.
"These are very, very difficult times for working families.. . I want to thank all of you for your help in getting Congress to support my bipartisan amendment to provide every working-class adult with $1,200, and $500 for their kids.. . Congress cannot leave without doing that."
"Today on Yom HaShoah we remember the 6 million Jews and so many others murdered in the Holocaust and recommit ourselves to the fight against anti-Semitism, bigotry and intolerance."
"58 new abortion restrictions were enacted across the country in 2019.. . Laws like these are dangerous, regressive, and blatantly unconstitutional.. . On the 47th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, we must continue to stand up for women’s reproductive freedom and protect access to abortion."
"A message to Wall Street: We will investigate your corruption. We will not let you cut the schools, hospitals and pensions that the Puerto Rican people need to live with dignity and recover from Hurricane Maria."
"We are taking on the ruling class, we are taking on the oligarchs, we are taking on the pharmaceutical industry, we are taking on the health care industry, we are taking on the fossil fuel industry. But if we stand together, we will win."
"LIVE: Handing a $10 billion bailout to Jeff Bezos to fuel his space hobby and giving $53 billion in corporate welfare to microchip companies might make sense to Bezos and the CEO of Intel, but it makes no sense to me."
"Here's how rigged the tax code is:. . If you make less than $25,000 a year you are 9 times more likely to be audited by the IRS than a CEO who makes $30 million.. . Meanwhile, the top 1% is responsible for 70% of the $381 billion in taxes that go unpaid each year. #TaxTheRich"
What we could do with $1.5 trillion:. -Make college tuition-free. -Provide universal preschool. -Repair our crumbling infrastructure. -Fund CHIP for 107 years. -Rebuild Puerto Rico. . What Republicans did:. -Give tax breaks to the wealthy and corporations
"Our job is to remind Trump and his allies what democracy is all about. By our grassroots activism we will defend President Lincoln's words “that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the Earth."""
"We cannot simply protect democracy. We must expand it, so that every person in America can participate in the political process."
"The trade union movement has led the fight for equal rights and economic and social justice. Today, Labor Day, we reflect on those struggles, and pledge our support to protecting workers’ rights and building an economy based on human needs, not corporate greed."
"How does it happen that there are major corporations in America where CEOs receive extravagant compensation packages, who pay their workers wages so low that many of them are forced to rely on food stamps to survive? . . That is what we will discuss tonight."
I hope that very soon the Senate will take two giant leaps forward for the American people: protect the voting rights of every American and pass the most consequential legislation to benefit working families in the modern history of our country.
"People may say, ""Oligarchy has to do with developing countries. What does it have to do with us?"". . Well, it has everything to do with the United States of America, because that is the direction in which we are moving."
Let us not kid ourselves. It is very easy for politicians like Trump to pound the table and talk about how tough they are. But it will not be the sons and daughters of billionaires who get killed in a war with Iran. It will be the working class kids of this country.
President Trump’s effort to dismantle the Postal Service would be a disaster for our seniors. We can't let Trump and his cronies have their way. Congress must act to save the Postal Service so seniors can access life-saving medication and mail-in ballots.
The Medicare for All Town Hall is tonight at 7 ET. Are you hosting a watch party?
Let me congratulate Sara Nelson and the flight attendants on their historic victory to ensure that 2 million airline workers receive their paychecks and benefits during this crisis.. . Congress must now extend these protections to every worker in America.
"Today, there are almost 600,000 people sleeping out on the streets of the wealthiest country in the world. There are 18 million households spending 50% of their limited incomes on housing..  . It’s time to build affordable housing and create good-paying jobs in the process."
We have got to get to the bottom of this. The American people have a right to know what deals Trump might be making with the murderous Saudi dictator that he loves so much.
"Take a look at what Finland, the happiest country in the world, is doing. If Finland can provide everyone with health care, send everyone to college for free and provide affordable child care, why can't the US? (featuring @anupartanen)"
This is very good news. We can't properly reform our broken criminal justice system without ending the death penalty. We must abolish the death penalty once and for all.
It’s not good enough to just be against Trump. We have to have a vision for this country of where we’re going to go. #InequalityTownHall
"How crazy is it that there was no in-state tuition for all students in California, until the 1970s? College was free.. . Not crazy at all. Don't let anyone tell you that we cannot tax Wall Street to fund tuition-free college and the cancellation of student debt."

"Let me congratulate the Starbucks workers in South Burlington for successfully voting to form the first unionized Starbucks in Vermont. In just 8 months, workers in over 160 Starbucks shops have voted to form a union for better wages, benefits & working conditions. Keep it up!"
Now is the time for Congress to show courage and stand up to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry. The American people will not accept surrender.”
"If 147 of America's richest companies had paid their 21% corporate tax rate instead of dodging taxes in 2018, we'd raise enough new revenue to eliminate homelessness and child hunger.. . Now you know why corporate America calls our agenda preposterous, unrealistic and unserious."
Far too often corporate television limits the nature of what we see and the discussions we have. This event will not be interrupted by commercials from drug or insurance companies or Wall Street. #MedicareForAll
"It is not a radical idea to say that every family in America should be entitled to high quality and affordable child care. Under the Build Back Better Plan, no working family in this country will be paying more than 7% of their income on child care."
.@RepJayapal visited a federal prison and met with asylum seekers who had been transferred from the border. What they told her is horrifying. We need to fight back against Trump's cruel immigration policy.
We have got to end the embarrassment of being the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee paid leave.
I thank public housing residents for sharing their stories with us today about their struggles and what green jobs could do for their communities. . . I am more committed than ever to work with @AOC to pass a Green New Deal and make dignified housing a human right.
"Yes. In terms of SALT we must protect the middle class from high local and state taxes. But we cannot provide 39% of the benefits to the top 1% – as is in the House bill. At a time of massive income inequality we must increase taxes on the 1%, not give them huge tax breaks."
This shows the contempt Republicans have for the needs of working class Americans.
"Mitch McConnell says $2,000 checks are ""socialism for the rich."" Ha!. . Here are the tax rebate checks corporations received from Trump's tax plan: . . Amazon: $129 million. Delta: $187 million. Chevron: $181 million. GM: $104 million. IBM: $342 million. . That's socialism for the rich!"

"""The only complaint I’ve ever heard from our members that are able to transfer over to Medicare is that they wish they could have done it sooner,” says @BMWEDIBT Director of Safety Roy Morrison. The time is NOW to lower the eligibility age for Medicare."
"Donald Trump will receive a tax break of up to $11 million a year as a result of the Republican tax plan he signed into law.. . Meanwhile, President Trump’s budget would eliminate after school programs for more than 1 million children."
"While Trump talks about a ""booming economy,"" the reality for working families is:. -Real wages for average workers are lower than in 1973. -80% live paycheck to paycheck. -Half of older Americans have no retirement savings. New Year’s Resolution: Create an economy that works for all."
"Today the Senate passed the Postal Service Reform Act. Is this all that is needed to fix the problems of the Postal Service? No, it is not. But it's an important step forward for one of our nation’s most important government agencies, for its workers, and for our communities."
We must put an end to corporate greed and support the growing union movement.
"I cannot understand this way of thinking from White House advisor Jared Kushner. It is not moral to have benefitted from the safe haven America provided our parents and grandparents fleeing violence, only to then slam the door shut on today's refugees."
Only 26% of Puerto Rico has electrical power and around 90% of the U.S. Virgin Islands is still without any electricity.

"The function of a rational health care system is to provide quality care to all in a cost-effective way, not make billionaires like Jeff Bezos even richer.  At a time of growing concentration of ownership, the Justice Department must deny Amazon's acquisition of One Medical."
"As a young person, I protested the Vietnam war. Americans were lied to and sent to die.. . After 18 years of lies and $1 trillion of war in Afghanistan, we are in the same place. We must end this war and build a society that stops this from happening again."
"How Amazon got to be so powerful, and what it means for our economy:"
"The American people are sick and tired of being ripped-off by corporations making record profits, while working families pay absurd prices for gas, rent and food. The time has come for Congress to work for working families and demand that big corporations pay their fair share."
"Wealthy campaign contributors gave $3.4 billion – with a ""b"" – to candidates and causes since 2009. That's what holds in place our rigged, corrupt economic and political systems. The time is now to get big money out of politics, and move to the public funding of elections."
"This is America, a nation of compassion and generosity. We will not allow Trump, Sessions or anyone else to continue a policy of ripping babies from the arms of their mothers. Together, we will defeat this inhumane and un-American action."
"The Trump administration declaring the war on poverty “largely over"" is a callous attempt to justify their efforts to make massive cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security disability, education and affordable housing, while they give huge tax breaks to billionaires."
"No parent should have to worry about outrageous medical bills while their child is sick. We must pass Medicare for all so that health care is a right for all people in America, not a privilege for a few who can afford it."
"We have got to do everything we can to make sure that right now, our people are safe, get the paychecks that they need, receive medical care for free, and have a roof over their heads.. . All American workers must be made whole."
How is it a tax reform plan for the middle class if 87 million middle class households will see their taxes go up?
"It’s a disgrace that the eviction moratorium is about to expire. Rent is due tomorrow. In case anyone forgot, we've been going through a deadly pandemic that caused an economic crisis. We can’t allow families to be thrown out on the street. Congress and the White House must act."
We will not tolerate our people going bankrupt to get treated for coronavirus or any other damn illness.. . We need Medicare for All.
What kind of society do we live in where tens of millions go hungry and jobless while 467 people—the richest 0.001% of America—each accumulate $5 billion a day during this pandemic?. . We're going to #MakeBillionairesPay to provide health care to our people.
Our obstacle to solving the climate crisis is not technological—it is political. We have what we need to rapidly move to a 100% renewable-energy economy. . . Now we must build a powerful political movement to make that happen.
"There is no excuse for medical workers in the richest country on Earth to lack masks, gloves, gowns and tests.. . If Trump won't act, Congress must. @RepRoKhanna and I are introducing legislation to rapidly manufacture all the medical equipment we need:"
"I congratulate the City Council of New Orleans for unanimously passing a resolution in support of Medicare for All!. . We must continue to build this grassroots energy at every level—in cities, counties and states across America—to finally guarantee health care to all our people."
"Now is the time to restore the faith of the American people in their government, to show them that we in fact can deliver for them, that we can improve their lives. .  . Let’s take on the lobbyists. Let’s take on the billionaires and powerful interests. Let’s get it done."
"Wall Street bankers say @AOC and I are wrong to advance the Loan Shark Prevention Act, which would put an end to sky-high interest rates on loans and credit cards. Guess what? They're wrong.. . Now economists are joining the fight. And they are on our side."
"Frito-Lay made more than $4.2 billion in sales last year. But they can't be bothered to provide fair wages and safe working conditions? I don’t think so. I stand with the workers on strike in Topeka. It takes enormous courage to stand up and fight back, and I applaud you."
"The Republican ""solution"" to inflation is to hold the full faith and credit of the US government hostage unless they are able to enact huge cuts to Social Security and Medicare at a time when 55% of seniors are trying to survive on less than $25,000 a year. Outrageous."
I say to Disney CEO Bob Iger: you can lead this country in ending the type of corporate greed which is causing so much pain. Start paying all of your workers a livable wage with decent benefits.
"Don't tell me the United States cannot implement a Medicare for All system to guarantee health care to every man, woman and child.. . If every other major country can do it, then surely so can we."
"There will no real social progress in this country unless we have the courage to take on Wall Street, the insurance companies, the drug companies, the military-industrial complex, the fossil fuel industry, the prison industry and all the other forces of greed."
"Workers at Amazon warehouses, Whole Foods grocery stores and Instacart food delivery do some of the most important jobs in America.. . These wealthy corporations must give them the paid sick leave, safe workplaces, and protective gear they are demanding."
"Senate Republicans, working directly with the White House, voted to prevent witnesses from testifying in Trump’s impeachment trial..  . What are Republicans afraid of? Today was a bad day for our country, for our Constitution, and for the rule of law."
This economy leaves far too many working people struggling to make ends meet. That has got to change.

"Last year, the six largest drug companies in the U.S. made nearly $50 billion dollars in profits. Meanwhile, Americans pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. That disgrace has got to end."
"40 million have lost their jobs. 100,000 are dead from coronavirus. Millions go hungry.. . I cannot comprehend how Senator McConnell can say he hasn't ""felt the urgency of acting immediately"" to pass legislation to protect Americans' health and wellbeing."
"In the last 3 months, as gas prices soared, Exxon Mobil doubled its profit to $5.5 billion. Instead of increasing supply or expanding production, what did Exxon do? Triple its stock buyback program to $30 billion to enrich its wealthy shareholders. We need a windfall profits tax."
"Whether America's climate-action plan is 1,000 pages long or two pages long, at the end of the day, we all know what it’s about. It’s about building the political power to tell the fossil fuel industry: Sorry, you cannot continue to destroy the planet for short-term profits."
Trump told us that “the rich will not be gaining at all” under his tax plan. That was quite a whopper. The legislation Trump signed into law provides 83 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent. #BernieResponds
"If workers are considered essential enough to show up on the job during a pandemic, I'm pretty damn sure they're essential enough to have a $15-an-hour living wage, paid sick leave, protective equipment, and health care as a right."
"It is unconscionable that amid global climate protests, tech giants like Microsoft are announcing major partnerships with Big Oil.. . We must hold them accountable, demand they break ties with the fossil fuel industry, and move rapidly to sustainable energy."
"I say to Howard Schultz: This is a pivotal moment for Starbucks. As you return to the company, it is time to do the right thing: End the union busting and obey the law."
U.S. student loan debt outstanding reached a record $1.465 trillion last month.. . You know the most revolting part of this crisis?. . The federal government makes billions in profits off of student loans each year.

"50 years ago, every dollar of an estate over $10 million was taxed at a rate of 77 percent. Since then, wealthy elites have worked to gut the estate tax—and inequality has exploded. . . Our job: Bring back this critical tool to stop the rise of oligarchy."
"If Republicans can end the filibuster to install right wing judges nominated by presidents who lost the popular vote in order to overturn Roe v. Wade, Democrats can and must end the filibuster to keep abortion legal and safe."
We must stand up to the ruling class.
"Gilead, one of the greediest pharmaceutical corporations in the world, is once again gouging people dealing with life-threatening illness."
"Just how rich are Wall Street speculators?. . A tax of just a few pennies on their financial trading can fund tuition-free public college for all and erase all $1,700,239,090,564 in student debt.. . This is how we make higher education a right in America."
Pretty pathetic. Mr. Trump is a coward who tears down others to make himself feel powerful.
This is the end of the internet as we know it. In Congress and in the courts we must fight back. #NetNeutrality
"While the cost of Halloween candy has surged more than 13.1% since last September, the Mars candy bar family became 44% richer during the pandemic increasing their wealth by $32.6 billion. The Mars family is now worth $106.8 billion.. . Do you know what’s scary? Corporate greed."
How has the outrageous cost of prescription drugs affected your life and the life of your family?
"Walmart & McDonald's pay wages so low that tens of thousands of their workers are forced to rely on food stamps, Medicaid & public housing. I invited the CEOs of these companies to a hearing to explain why they can't afford to pay a $15 minimum wage. Taxpayers deserve an answer."
"If Scotland can demand that Amazon get off corporate welfare and pay its workers a living wage, then so can the US. Now is the time for people to come together around the world to take on the greed of the oligarchs."
I'll join civil rights and labor leaders tomorrow in Memphis to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King's assassination. Dr. King was not only one of the great civil rights leaders of the 20th century. He was also at the forefront of the fight for economic justice.
"Foreign policy matters: After 20 years of U.S. effort, the loss of 2,448 soldiers and a trillion spent, Afghanistan was left with a corrupt government and an ineffectual military.  At this moment, we must do everything we can to evacuate our allies and open our doors to refugees."
I’m delighted to see an agreement reached so that the MLB season can start. But we must prevent the greed of baseball’s oligarchs from destroying the game. The best way to do that is to end MLB’s antitrust exemption and I will be introducing legislation to do just that.
"Leilani Jordan said she wasn't given gloves or hand sanitizer..  . Now this grocery worker is dead at 27 over a $20.64 paycheck..  . Is this what America is about? Or will we fight for protective gear, hazard pay, and paid sick leave for all frontline"
61 million kids received direct payments of up to $300 in August from the expanded Child Tax Credit. That is no small thing. It’s how we start to end the international embarrassment of the U.S. having one of the highest rates of childhood poverty of any major country.
"75 years ago at Normandy, the United States and its allies led the largest land invasion in history to help free Europe from Nazi barbarism. We will never forget the young people who gave their lives. We honor them by working toward a world of freedom, dignity and peace for all."
Shock of all shocks: It turns out that President Trump was not being honest when he said he was going to stop the prescription drug companies from “getting away with murder.” Another day. Another lie.
HISTORIC VICTORY: The Senate has voted to stop U.S. military support for the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen. This is the first time ever that the Senate has voted to end an unauthorized war.
"Article 25: ""A standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care"". . Do not let anybody try to tell you that health care and housing are not fundamental human rights."
"Millions of families need federal help right now for the food, shelter, income, and health care they need.. . The absolute last thing Congress should be doing is shoveling money to boost the profits of arms manufacturers like Lockheed and Raytheon."
Today marks 12 YEARS since the last increase in the federal minimum wage. Is it really a shock that a full-time worker making minimum wage in 2021 can’t afford rent ANYWHERE in the U.S.? It's time to end starvation wages and raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
"The oligarchs in Davos party, the poor suffer. While 260 million people throughout the world will likely be pushed into extreme poverty this year – trying to survive on less than $2 a day – over 2,000 billionaires across the globe became $3.78 trillion richer during the pandemic."
My response to President Trump’s State of the Union address:
A great nation is not judged by its number of billionaires or corporate tax breaks. It's judged by how we treat our most vulnerable people.
"Jane and I wish everyone a merry Christmas and a happy holiday. As we head into a new year, let us rededicate ourselves to a world of peace and justice."
"It is no great secret that women throughout the history of our country have had to fight for their basic human rights against all forms of patriarchy, so today let us be absolutely clear: When it comes to women’s rights, we cannot go backwards. We must go forward."
It looks like the president’s promises to help working people were just another lie. Trump is already moving to destroy safety net programs that millions of people rely on.
"Thank you, Dolly Parton. Hopefully, the people of Tennessee and this country will be listening to you more than your governor."
"What @RepRoKhanna and I are saying is simple: The U.S. must stop enabling the disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen. The war has gone on far too long, and it’s time we begin to take bold steps on the path to peace."
"The House passed a $2,000 direct payment for working people. Now it's the Senate's turn. If McConnell doesn't agree to an up or down vote to provide the working people of our country a $2,000 direct payment, Congress will not be going home for New Year's Eve. Let's do our job."
Every Republican except the chairman has left the budget hearing on the tax bill. Why are they afraid to defend their plan to raise taxes on 87 million middle class households?
"Today at 4:30pm ET, I'll be on the floor of the Senate to once again talk about legislation that hands a $76 billion blank check to the microchip industry. Yes. We need to rebuild the microchip industry, but not in in a way that just benefits profitable corporations."
Right-wing extremists in every state and every branch of government have worked for decades to make it more and more difficult for women to access abortion. We cannot let them win. Abortion is a constitutional right that must be protected.
"Congratulations—now that @Instacart is worth $14 billion, maybe it can afford hazard pay and paid sick leave for all its workers."
It will take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and the reality that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs by having Medicare negotiate prescription drug prices with drug companies.
"There's no reason why we shouldn't expand Medicare to every man, woman and child in this country. All it takes is will."
"We spend $700 billion on defense, more than the next 10 nations combined, and end up with 30 million uninsured and crumbling infrastructure. . . Mr. President, instead of demanding that Europe spend more on planes and guns, why don’t we join them in guaranteeing health care to all."
"Mitch McConnell is wrong. Since 1979, when a state has increased the min. wage, employment and wages typically go up, not down. A $15 minimum wage would raise wages for 39 million people and lift millions of Americans out of poverty. Why is McConnell afraid to let us vote on it?"
I stand with the thousands of Puerto Ricans protesting the latest austerity measures. We must stop treating Puerto Rico like a colony and start treating the people of Puerto Rico as the fellow American citizens that they are.
"If the Majority Leader wants to defend starvation wages to the people of Kentucky, that is his right. . . But I say to Mitch McConnell: let the American people have a vote on a $15 minimum wage."
"Congress can't go home for the Christmas holidays until we pass legislation which provides a $1,200 direct payment to working class adults, $2,400 for couples and $500 for kids. This is what Democrats & Republicans did in March through the CARES Act. It's what we must do today."
It's absurd that the United States is the only advanced country that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation time. A mom and a dad ought to have the right to at least a couple of weeks of paid vacation so they can spend quality time with their kids.
The Trump administration is putting us on the path to war. Trump’s foreign policy is a disaster and must be stopped.
The U.S.-backed Saudi war in Yemen has created the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. I join with my colleagues in calling on the Biden administration to demand an end to the Saudi blockade and allow desperately needed aid into the country.
"The recent wave of arrests in Egypt of courageous human rights defenders from @EIPR is an outrage. The incoming administration must make it clear to Egypt and all countries that, once again, the United States will support democracy, not dictatorship."
"84% of Democrats want the Senate to pass a $2,000 direct payment. . 73% of Republicans want the Senate to pass a $2,000 direct payment. . 74% of Independents want the Senate to pass a $2,000 direct payment. . The House approved a $2,000 direct payment. . Let the Senate vote, Mitch!"
"NO WAR WITH IRAN! This would be an unmitigated disaster. We must stop Trump and his national security advisor, John Bolton—someone who likes endless wars."
"""Here it is, we're giving millionaires tax cuts. You're going to give them $27,000... I can't even say that's half of my salary."" Arizona teachers like Tomorrah Howard are standing up to fight for fair pay."
"Further, at a time when too many Americans are harboring homicidal and/or suicidal thoughts, we must greatly improve access to mental health counseling."
"Responding to the pandemic with a fierce sense of urgency means providing every working-class person in America with an emergency $2,000 payment each month until this crisis is over so that they can pay the rent, feed their families and make ends meet."
I hope that in a bipartisan way we can come together and do what the overwhelming majority of American people want us to do: pass commonsense gun safety legislation to keep our children and families safe.
NAFTA did not just destroy 1 million American jobs—it forced millions of Mexican family farmers off their land and fueled a migration crisis.. . We need a humane immigration system. But we must also end the disastrous corporate trade deals that have devastated Latin America.
"Congress and President Trump must finally have the courage to stand up to the NRA, and do what the American people want – pass common sense gun safety legislation."
"Thanks for that question, John. I hope you tune in tonight to learn what Medicare for All would really do for Americans."
"A $15 minimum wage is not a radical idea. What's radical is the fact that millions of Americans are forced to work for starvation wages, while 650 billionaires became over $1 trillion richer during a global pandemic. Yes. We must raise the minimum wage to a living wage."
"Today, almost half the Senate Democratic Caucus—23 members—voted to cut Pentagon spending by 10% and invest in human needs. This is far and away the most significant step in recent years to address our bloated $740 billion military budget and changing our national priorities."
"Just like we defeated Republicans' efforts to repeal Obamacare, we need to stop their tax plan. Join me and @MoveOn tonight at 8 ET at to get ready to fight back."
"This drug was free for patients just weeks ago. Now, patients around the country are rationing their medication because they have no idea how they will afford it. . . Meanwhile, Catalyst Pharmaceuticals is set to make hundreds of millions of dollars off their suffering."
"Republicans have got to fix the DACA crisis Trump precipitated. We are not going to allow 800,000 young Dreamers to be deported."
"In this pivotal moment, if we have the courage to educate, organize and go forward, we will win this struggle. We must expand Medicare benefits and lower the age of Medicare eligibility in America."
Happy to be home in Burlington. It's a warm and pleasant afternoon on Lake Champlain. #Vermont
"During the financial crisis, Wall Street received the largest taxpayer bailout in American history. Now it is Wall Street’s turn to help rebuild the disappearing middle class. #CancelStudentDebt"
"Since Trump has been in office, he has provided $425 billion in federal contracts to companies that have shipped 200,000 jobs overseas. No, Mr. President. You're not standing up for working families when you give the largest outsourcers in America billions in corporate welfare."
"Returning asylum-seekers to Mexico where there is no oversight or accommodation is wrong.. . If we turn our backs on refugees, we will be destroying what this country is supposed to be about."
"After 35 days of pain and suffering for federal workers and contractors during the Trump shutdown, what's the first thing that the GOP leadership decides to do? Make the wealthiest families in America even richer."
The main reason for the financial problems at the Postal Service stems from a 2006 mandate forcing it to pre-fund 75-years of retiree health benefits to employees who haven’t been born yet. No other business or government agency is burdened with such an absurd requirement.
"This Memorial Day, we say to veterans who came home from war that we honor your service, and we will make sure every man and woman who has served our country gets the best health care they can through a strong Veterans Administration."
My Republican colleagues don’t think we should do anything about climate change. They are dead wrong..  . We’re going to act and act boldly by passing major legislation to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels. The future of the planet is at stake.
"The fight for Medicare for all will be opposed by all of the special interests—drug companies, insurance companies, Wall Street—who make billions from our dysfunctional health care system.. . They may have the money. But we have the people."
I am proud to have stood with working people to stop efforts to cut and privatize Social Security over the years.. . Social Security is the most successful government program in our nation's history.. . Our job is to protect it and expand it.
Let's not forget that 20 million Americans have health insurance under the Affordable Care Act who previously did not. #HealthCareDebate
Trump is clearly very afraid of the prospect of the Senate delivering a serious rebuke to his policy by voting to end U.S. support for the Yemen war. But that is exactly what we will do when we vote on SJ Res 54 next week.
"On Memorial Day, we honor the brave Americans who gave their lives to defend our country. We reaffirm a grateful nation’s commitment to their loved ones, and to everyone who has served."
More than one out of every four doctors in America are immigrants. What an utter disgrace.
I want to congratulate the groups and organizations who made clear that we do not need more fossil fuel projects that would substantially increase carbon emissions. . . The removal of the big oil side deal is a victory for the planet and a major loss for the fossil fuel industry.
"Why is that? There are a number of reasons, but at the top of the list is the reality that the mainstream media has done an exceptionally poor job in covering what actually is in the legislation."
One of the hardest things that has to happen now is for ordinary people to stand up and say: this is United States of America and the pain that we're seeing should not be happening. #InequalityTownHall
"Vulnerable nursing home residents are being kicked out on the street to fend for themselves, in a pandemic, because they're considered ""less-profitable."" How disgusting!. . We cannot tolerate a health care system driven by such staggering greed and cruelty."
Republicans' budget cuts Medicaid by more than $1 trillion over 10 years – which would throw some 15 million Americans off health insurance.
"How in the world are people supposed to stay home safely during a pandemic when utility companies are shutting their water off?.  . We must restore service to families who've been disconnected, forgive all utility debt, and freeze future disconnections until this crisis ends."
"We can no longer allow big oil companies, huge corporations and the billionaire class to use the murderous Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing pandemic as an excuse to price gouge consumers. It is time to enact a windfall profits tax and reasonable price controls."
"Since 2016, 14 top pharmaceutical companies spent $577 billion on stock buybacks and dividends – $56 billion more than research and development. We must lower the outrageous price of prescription drugs in budget reconciliation and use the savings to expand Medicare with 51 votes."
The United States is the only major country on Earth not to guarantee paid family and medical leave. 73% of the American people want that to change. What are we waiting for?
As a nation we must fix our broken health care system and give mental and behavioral health care the attention and resources they deserve. #WorldMentalHealthDay
"LIVE: The Senate Budget Committee is holding a hearing on the income and wealthy inequality crisis. The time is now to build an economy that works for all, not just the wealthy and huge corporations."
"Republicans L-O-V-E to give tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations, so I understand why they might be a little shocked that we are finally going to invest in working families.. . It’s time to create an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1%."
"Our job: Fight back against the reactionary Trump agenda and for a progressive agenda that works for the middle class, not the 1%."
Thank you @CarmenYulinCruz for your tireless work. We we will do everything we can to see that Puerto Rico is rebuilt.
"We must speak with one voice in making clear to Vladimir Putin: ""We will not allow you to interfere in our democratic processes or those of our allies."" President Trump himself should be the one to bring this message to Putin."
"Nonpartisan experts confirmed to @HouseBudgetDems that #MedicareforAll could offer universal coverage, lower costs, and stronger wages. I applaud @USProgressives @RepJohnYarmuth, @RepJayapal and @RepRoKhanna for holding this hearing to build the case for health care as a right."
"I hear Republicans complaining about $20,000 in student debt forgiveness. Funny, I didn't hear those complaints when Trump declared bankruptcy 6 times & had $287 million in loans forgiven by big banks. The GOP l-o-v-e-s socialism for the rich, rugged individualism for the rest."
The industries making obscene profits off of health care have armies of Washington lobbyists willing to block any progress—no matter how small.. . Our job is to build a movement strong enough to defeat their greed and deliver Medicare for All to the people.
"My dad came from a very poor, rural area in Poland. He raised a family and became a very proud American.. . When Trump demonizes minorities and immigrants, he wants to divide us up.. . We must build a political movement to create a different kind of America—with values that unite us."
".@SecPompeo: An attack on Saudi oil is NOT an attack on America. If you want a war, come to Congress to make your case. We will not let you drag the American people into another catastrophe in the Middle East.. . Your job is to use diplomacy to resolve conflict—not incite more war."
"American families are paying an $8,000 tax because of the greed of the health care industry. Don't take it from me. Take it from these economists.. . Medicare for All means huge savings for working people and guaranteed health care for all."
I will vote no on reauthorizing Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The bill as written gives the government far too much power to spy on innocent U.S. citizens.
"Second, the $165 billion increase in defense spending is much too large. I believe in a strong military, but at a time when the U.S. spends more on defense than the next 12 countries combined, the last thing we should do is massively increase the Pentagon’s budget."
"Are you prepared to stand up to the pharmaceutical industry?. Are you prepared to stand up to the fossil fuel industry?. Are you prepared to stand up to the ruling class?. . If you are prepared to do all of that, then together we can create a nation that is based on justice."
"Starbucks could give every one of its 383,000 workers a $5,000 bonus & still keep $2.6 billion in profits from last year. Instead they're raising prices while spending $20 billion on stock buybacks & dividends when profits are up 31%. Don't blame inflation. Blame corporate greed."
"DuPont knowingly dumped poisons in our water for decades. The victims are children like Abigail Herrmann who are drinking ""forever chemicals"" across America.. . Congress must pass my PFAS Act to hold corporate polluters accountable for cleaning up this mess."
"While Trump and Paul Ryan continue their attempts to destroy Social Security, 150 of my colleagues and I launched the Expand Social Security Caucus yesterday to make sure seniors can retire in dignity."
"Today, with @SenMarkey and @SenGillibrand, I am introducing a 60% tax on the obscene wealth gains of 467 billionaires during this pandemic in order to guarantee healthcare as a right to all for an entire year. #MakeBillionairesPay"
"65% of PR has telecommunications access, but there are concerns of a total collapse of wireless service unless enough electricity can return"
"Maybe – just maybe – Congress should respond to the demands of the American people and finally expand Medicare to cover dental, vision and hearing."
"If the tax plan is passed, giving huge breaks to the 1% and raising the deficit $1.5 trillion, Republican leaders will rediscover ""the deficit crisis"" and move aggressively to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid."
"Meanwhile, the Walton family of Walmart has a net worth of $144 billion. This is what a rigged economy looks like."
"Finally, I believe the Senate must substantially expand direct emergency payments to working families. In my view, one additional $1,200 check is not enough. The Senate must provide a $2,000 per month emergency payment for every American until this crisis is over."
"I do not want to see what the history books will say about this Congress if we allow 800,000 Dreamers to be deported. It would be an indelible moral stain on our country if we fail to act."
The future of working families is at stake. The future of our democracy is at stake. The future of our planet is at stake.. . Now is the time.
"$34,927.43.. . That is the medical bill an uninsured patient got for being tested and treated for the coronavirus.. . This is not the time for obscene profits or price-gouging.. . Right now we must make health care free—including for the 30 million uninsured."
"Amazon’s warehouses are one of the most dangerous places to work in the U.S. According to the NCOSH, seven Amazon workers have died on or near the job since 2013. I will be asking OSHA to investigate unsafe working conditions at Amazon fulfillment centers."
I support the Transport Workers Union in their struggle against American Airlines. This is what a strong union and strong union leadership is about:
"Remember when Trump promised that his tax giveaway to the rich would put an extra $4,000 into the pockets of middle-class families?. . The reality: bonuses for average workers are up by just two cents an hour since Trump’s tax plan was signed into law. Two cents."
"The Paradise Papers make clear that we need, in the United States and throughout the world, a tax system which is fair, progressive and transparent."
"The bottom line is: Americans do not want us to pass tax breaks for billionaires and they certainly don’t want us to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid."
"After receiving billions in federal contracts, Pfizer wants to charge up to $130 for a COVID vaccine shot that costs as little as $1.18 to manufacture – 10,000% above cost. Enough is enough. The COVID vaccine should cost $0. Pfizer's greed is killing people throughout the world."
"Good. If we criminalize compassion, we have lost our way as a society. Providing humanitarian aid to men, women and children so that they do not die in the desert—whether on the border or anywhere—is not a crime."
How many tragedies must we witness before Republicans in Congress agree to pass legislation to end this epidemic of senseless slaughter?
"There's no crisis at the border. President Trump, you want to talk about crises?.  . -30 million Americans have no health insurance. -Climate change threatens our planet. -Half of older Americans have no retirement savings. -40 million are dealing with outrageous student debt"
We are facing a public health crisis. We must: . . 🏥 Reverse cuts to local public health agencies and Centers for Disease Control. 👩🏽‍⚕️ Provide full federal funding for all testing and treatment for the coronavirus. 🛌 Guarantee paid sick leave to every worker
Republicans say tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations help small businesses. Here’s the truth: They don’t.
"If you think the shutdown we're experiencing right now isn't related to our disastrous campaign finance system, you would be dead wrong."
Ted Cruz: Social Security is a Ponzi scheme. #CNNDebateNight
"This is obscene: while the top 25 hedge-fund managers each take home an average of $850 million a year, nearly half of college students have to skip meals for the crime of pursuing an education. We must ensure tuition-free college for all, funded by a tax on Wall Street greed."
"Democracy means one person, one vote. It does not mean billionaires like Sheldon Adelson buying elections. Our job:. . -Overturn Citizens United. -Move toward public funding of elections. -End voter suppression"
"Amazon, Trader Joe’s and Berkshire Hathaway figured out a way to make this crisis even more horrific for workers: Union-busting.. . If there were ever a time to stand against corporate greed and with workers fighting for their rights, that time is now."
"When Yemenis see “Made in USA” on the bombs that are killing them, it tells them that the USA is responsible for this war.. . This is not the message we should be sending to the world. Congress must end support for the catastrophic war in Yemen led by a despotic Saudi regime."
"It is unbelievable that this needs to be said: American citizens are not something to be “cleaned up,” Mr. Trump.. . I have a much better idea. Build homes for all 552,730 unsheltered people, at a cost of less than 10% of Trump’s tax cut for the rich and large corporations."
"Yes, it is more important to protect the babies of this country than the huge CEO compensation packages and stock buybacks of an infant formula company that lied to the FDA. That’s not a radical idea."
"""We must move from considering others as threats to our comfort to valuing them as persons whose life experience and values can contribute greatly to the enrichment of our society."" –Pope Francis"
"The Senate Republican Budget: . . - Throws 32 million off healthcare . - Cuts Medicare and Medicaid . - Kicks 175,000 kids off Head Start . - Denies nutrition assistance to 5 million pregnant moms and babies . - Provides more tax breaks to the Top 1%"
What I am asking for is straightforward: Masks for All.
"The evidence of Trump’s guilt is so overwhelming that the Republican Party, for the first time in the history of presidential impeachment, obstructed testimony from witnesses—even willing witnesses."
"Average cost of a year of college: $50,000. Median family income: $61,000. . We let middle-class parents drown in debt trying to ensure a middle-class future for their kids. That is obscene.. . We must cancel student debt and make public colleges tuition-free."
What “entitlement reform” actually means is massive cuts to Social Security at a time when millions of older workers have nothing in the bank for their retirement.
"Tonight I asked my Republican colleague Sen. Toomey to guarantee to the American people there would not be cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid after this tax bill. He couldn't do that."
"@MittRomney So, apparently, when corporate America needs a blank check of $76 billion, we do what other countries are doing. When other countries protect the needs of their workers, their children, their elderly somehow that is not a club we join."
"I am excited to announce that on July 16 we will hold a live streamed town hall with workers from Amazon, Disney, McDonald’s and Walmart. I hope their CEOs will have the guts to sit on a panel with their own employees."
"Average cost of a C-section:. . 🇪🇸 $2,352. 🇬🇧 $4,435. 🇦🇺 $5,186. 🇫🇷 $6,441. . 🇺🇸 $15,041. . We can afford Medicare for All. What we can't afford is continuing to charge women in the U.S. more than any other country for giving birth."
"If we mobilize, if we come together, if we have a vision – based on justice – of where we want our country to go, we can win. We can create the world that we know we can become."
President Trump talks about bringing back fossil fuels. It’s not going to happen. Solar is the future.
"Listen to this historian explain why Trump chants ""Build That Wall!"" (with @TimothyDSnyder)"
"Maybe, just maybe, we should make sure our people are not dying because they lack health insurance before we start spending billions to militarize outer space. #SpaceForce"
"Pope Francis is absolutely right. During the worst public-health crisis in 100 years, we must cut funding for making weapons to kill each other and invest those resources in real human needs, like a coronavirus vaccine available to all."
"Now that this decision has been put in Congress’ hands, it’s up to us to stop this drift toward war."
I have long been troubled by the nature of the relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. It's time for us to thoroughly reevaluate that relationship.
"The Gulf of Oman incident must not be used as a pretext for war with Iran. War would be an unmitigated disaster for the United States, Iran, the region, and the world. A unilateral U.S. attack on Iran would be illegal and unconstitutional."
Bipartisan majorities of Congress told Mr. Trump to end this unconstitutional war. Now we must use Congress’s power of the purse to block every nickel of taxpayer money from going to help the Saudi dictatorship as it bombs and starves civilians in Yemen.
@david_l_alvarez Thank you. My condolences and thoughts are with you and your family. Your father is an example of what America is all about.
"Maybe I’m the “radical” one, but I don’t think it's acceptable that the top 25 Wall Street hedge fund managers made over $15 billion in compensation in 2017—nearly double what all 140,000 kindergarten teachers in America made last year."
"Congratulations, President Trump, on being the first president in history whose speech on ""bringing down drug prices"" sent pharma stocks soaring."
"CEOs at Merck and Pfizer each make almost $50 million a year. A senior's median income is $25,000 a year.. . Pharma CEOs get rich charging the world’s highest prices. Seniors cut their pills in half and skip groceries trying to afford them.. . That is disgusting and has got to end."
"The richest 400 billionaires pay lower taxes than everyone else. In my view, this obscene inequality in wealth and political power is not compatible with a democratic society. I am proud to support the introduction of the For The 99.8% Act in the House by @RepJimmyGomez."
"For those who say the budget framework I proposed costs ""too much"" what would you cut?. . Combatting climate change?. . Childcare?. . Universal Pre-K?. . Paid family & medical leave?. . Dental, hearing & vision?. . Housing?. . Long-term home health care?. . Child Tax Credit?. . Waiting..."
"The $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill is enormously popular. A recent Quinnipiac University Poll shows 57 percent of the American people support it, including 92 percent of Democrats. Obviously it is exactly the bill that a Democratic Congress should pass."
"You’re right, @RepAOC. We will ensure a dignified life, with parks, gardens, and community centers, for our public housing residents. We invest $172 billion in retrofits that improve health, safety and comfort—while eliminating all carbon emissions in our public housing."
"Eye glasses, hearing aids, and dentist visits are health care. Period. It’s time to expand Medicare so millions of Americans can live in dignity."
That's what the American people want. That's what we must deliver.
"While big banks and large corporations are able to borrow money for virtually no interest, it is absolutely unacceptable that low-income Americans are being charged 400% interest on a $375 payday loan. We need to put predatory lenders out of business and move to postal banking."
"In the midst of a horrific pandemic, two-thirds of low-wage workers still lack access to paid sick leave. That is barbaric..  . We must guarantee that all workers have a right to paid sick leave."
"Big surprise: Under Trump, another head of a federal agency who is supposed to serve the public good is actually furthering family and business interests. The corruption and nepotism of this administration, from Trump on down, never ends."
"Another reminder that as soon as Republicans pass their massive tax cut for the wealthy and large corporations – running up a $1.4 trillion deficit – they will turn around and say we must cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid."
"Our infrastructure is collapsing, our health care system is dysfunctional, our political system is corrupt and we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality. And Trump spends most of his time talking about a wall. It's time for a real change."
"Trump's recent tweet that we delay our election ""is fascistic and itself grounds for immediate impeachment."" That's not Bernie Sanders talking. That's Steven Calabresi, co-founder of the rightwing Federalist Society.. . Trump is a threat to democracy. Together we will defeat him."
"With Democratic control of the House, the Senate, and the White House, we must keep our promise to the American people and finally raise a $7.25 starvation wage to a $15-an-hour living wage.. . The American people need a raise, and they need it NOW."
"When Congress asks the Attorney General to testify or provide information, he's got to do it. I support those who are prepared to hold him in contempt for stonewalling. The American people are entitled to this information and the House should be as tough as they can be."
The bad news: We have just 11 years to take bold steps to rapidly transform our energy system to sustainable energy if the planet is going to remain habitable.. . The good news: We can revitalize our economy and create tens of millions of jobs in the process.
It's time for Democrat and Republican leaders to recognize that a progressive agenda isn't radical. It's what the majority of American voters support. @DataProgress
"IBM fired 12,000 workers and gave executives a $7 million raise after bringing $9.5 billion back into the US in 2004, yet Republicans want to give the company a $13.9 billion tax cut."
"On #PrimeDay, let's not forget. Amazon blamed ""inflation"" on a 17% price hike in a Prime membership after its profits soared 450% since the pandemic to a record $38 billion while avoiding $5 billion in taxes, spending $4 million on union busting & denying workers paid sick leave."
The United States needs to end the international embarrassment of being the only industrialized nation not to provide paid family leave.
"Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in history, and he must be held accountable. I strongly believe the announcement of articles of impeachment are appropriate and necessary, and I call on the full House to pass them."
I have strong concerns that the Trump administration is getting the U.S. more involved in a war in Yemen without congressional authorization. I'll be seeking further clarification on these activities. We must prevent the U.S. from getting dragged into another never-ending war.
"The American people want to know: If we could bail out the crooks on Wall Street, how come we can't protect working class families and enable their kids to get a college education?"
"I get a little tired of seeing these TV ads from big corporations thanking heroes on the frontlines of the pandemic. Well that's great, thank them—but PAY them more than starvation wages for their extremely hazardous work."
Have your prescriptions shot up in price? Are you splitting pills in half to make your prescriptions last longer? Have you had to stop taking medicine altogether in order to pay other bills? Tell Bernie your story.
The deliberate Russian attacks against civilians in Ukraine are horrifying. Those responsible for these atrocities must be held accountable.
"The sailors cheering for Captain Crozier are right.. . The Navy appears to be retaliating against him for acting out of concern for his sailors' health. His position should be restored immediately.. . Amidst this horrible pandemic, we must speak the truth and protect each other."

"Just 3% of Brett Kavanaugh's records have been released. If Republicans believe Kavanaugh deserves a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court, why are they afraid to show the American people what Kavanaugh has written?"
"Together, we will defeat the Trump administration's inhumane and un-American policy of ripping babies from the arms of their mothers and fathers."
"Let me remind my conservative Democratic colleagues who are concerned about fiscal responsibility, the Build Back Better Act will be fully paid for by taxes on the wealthy. The bipartisan infrastructure bill you voted for will add $256 billion to the deficit. Let's be consistent."
"I understand that Republican Leader Mitch McConnell is shocked that for once in a very long time the Congress is going to stand with working families and not on the side of the rich and powerful. . . As he has made very clear, his philosophy is the polar opposite."
"Recognition of the Armenian genocide is long overdue, and I applaud President Biden for this announcement. It is important for all of us to look honestly at history to make sure such atrocities never happen again."
"Kavanaugh claimed that he and Dr. Ford “did not travel in the same social circles.” Dr. Ford said she dated Chris Garrett, referenced as a friend in his yearbook. In fact she testified Garrett introduced her to Kavanaugh. (9/x)"
I don't think Medicare for all is an extreme idea. Every other major country on Earth guarantees health care as a right. #HealthCareDebate
It will make higher education affordable by allowing everyone to attend community college tuition-free.
"We must stand up to a corrupt oligarchy. It is not acceptable that the top 1% now owns more wealth than our entire middle class. We must pass the $3.5 trillion Build Back Better Act, invest in the working class & take on the greed of the billionaires by taxing the rich."
"It is outrageous that in the richest country in the history of the world, people are going hungry. Congress must radically increase food assistance programs and offer grocery delivery options to ensure all people are able to eat safely during this crisis."
The United States Senate just voted to repeal the disastrous FCC decision to end #NetNeutrality. We must demand that the House does the right thing and stands with the Senate to overturn this decision.
Puerto Rico is in dire need of increased food assistance funding.. . It's unconscionable that we've allowed our fellow Americans to suffer for so long without the full resources of the U.S. government. . . We must act now to end this crisis.
"In our country today, we pay more per capita for prescription drugs than any other major country on Earth. . . Enough. It’s time to put an end to Big Pharma controlling Congress. It’s time for Congress to regulate Big Pharma."
Does it make more sense to give tax breaks to the top 1% or rebuild our infrastructure and create 15 million jobs? #CNNDebateNight
"Life-threatening diseases linked to Agent Orange are afflicting 83,000 veterans of the Vietnam War—and the White House refuses to cover their care. This is outrageous..  . @SenatorTester and I are demanding these veterans get the coverage they deserve now. No more excuses."

"Per capita spending on health care:.  . 🇬🇧: $5,268. 🇨🇦: $5,370. 🇫🇷: $5,564.  . 🇺🇸: $12,530.  . How does it happen that we spend so much money for health care, but get so little in return?"

"Mr. Trump now says he prefers to talk to Iran, after threatening a disastrous military conflict with them. Good.. . The president can show he is serious about diplomacy by rejoining the nuclear deal he recklessly withdrew from last year."
I hope we will soon vote on this common-sense bill in the Senate and start to stem the tide of gun violence in this country.
I will not tell the young people that we can't address the climate crisis.. I will not tell people that are homeless that we can't build affordable housing. . I will not tell families that we can't make child care affordable.. . We must address the needs of the working class.
"Whether you're a Republican, a Democrat or an Independent, Americans understand that right now, the richest people in this country and the largest corporations are doing phenomenally well while the middle class of this country struggles.. . That is going to change."
"Congratulations to the advocates in Oregon who won a major victory today. The right to a clean environment is more important than the short-term profits of the fossil fuel industry. Our job: break our addiction to fossil fuels, not increase our dependence on fracked natural gas."
Big Oil's 1st Quarter Profit in 2022: $35 billion. Average Price of Gas today: $4.91. . Big Oil's 1st Quarter Profit in 2019: $13.8 billion. Average Gas Price: $2.69. . Big Oil's 1st Quarter Profit in 2015: $13.1 billion. Average Gas Price: $2.41. . Yes. We need a windfall profits tax.
"If Howard Schultz, the Starbucks CEO, who is worth $4 billion can afford a $145 million, 254-foot super yacht with a helicopter pad, you know what? He can afford to negotiate a fair first contract with Starbucks workers who voted to form a union in over 230 locations in America."

"In their never-ending quest to throw millions off health insurance and raise premiums, the Trump Administration is now arguing in court that it should be legal for insurance companies to discriminate against the 130 million people with pre-existing conditions. That is a disgrace."
"It takes enormous bravery to go to the streets to protest Iran’s authoritarian “Supreme Leader.” But, led by courageous young women, that’s exactly what’s happening. I stand with all of those Iranians who are demanding freedom and a better future."
"Jeff Bezos, worth $179 billion, said: ""The only way that I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel."" . . Mr. Bezos, here's an idea—take care of your workers here on planet Earth. Let them unionize."
We are in the worst economic condition since the Great Depression. People are worried about getting evicted from their homes. People can't go to the doctor because they lost their jobs and no longer have any health insurance.. . Now is the time for Congress to act boldly.
Alec Smith died at 26 because he was rationing insulin that was too expensive. Corporate greed is taking the lives of Americans and it needs to end now.
“Not only is it the right thing to do – it is ECONOMICALLY the right thing to do.” –Republican Mayor Dale Ross on transitioning to renewable energy. #ClimateTownHall
The Republican tax plan sticks it to working families and makes it harder for students to pay for college. Here's how:
Fact check: The Trump administration cannot keep their own story straight about the abhorrent practice of separating families at the border. Here is the truth about what's happening.
"Recently, I had the opportunity to speak to a group of courageous young people from Israel and Palestine who are working to build a better, more peaceful future. As yet another round of conflict threatens to erupt, I urge you to listen to what they have to say."
"As if workers' earnings weren't low enough already, President Trump now wants to make it legal for employers to steal workers' tips."
PhRMA lobbying to increase the price of life-saving prescription drugs for seniors in a bill to help address the opioid epidemic is a perfect example of what is wrong with Washington D.C.
There are five times as many kids in child detention centers now than there were a year ago.. . Let me repeat that. There are FIVE TIMES as many children locked up and separated from their families than at this time last year.
"Question: Why do we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs? Answer: The pharmaceutical industry has spent $4.5 billion over the last 20 years in lobbying and campaign contributions. Congress must have the courage NOW to lower drug prices."
".@realDonaldTrump, climate change is real, very real—and it is devastating our planet. Stop protecting the interests and short-term profits of the fossil fuel industry, and start worrying about the world future generations will inherit."
"This pandemic makes it clear how dysfunctional our healthcare system is. Not only do we pay the highest prices in the world, we can’t even produce the number of doctors and nurses that we desperately need. Let us not give up the struggle for Medicare for All."
Thank you @USStudents for organizing students across the country to get involved in the fight for College for All.
"Years from now people will ask, “What world was the Senate living in when they considered drilling for oil in Alaska, while climate change was causing devastating damage?"""
"Americans are sick and tired of our wasteful, inefficient, dysfunctional health care system. They want Medicare for all."
This is nothing less than sexism. It's the latest display of Republicans’ total disdain for women’s ability to control their own lives.
"I stand with the people of Puerto Rico taking to the streets to demand accountability for the governor and an end to corruption.. . After dealing with hurricanes and a decade of austerity, Puerto Ricans have a right to democracy and full federal support to get out of this crisis."
Let's be clear: the government has a moral responsibility to provide for the vulnerable. But taxpayers should not have to expend huge sums of money subsidizing profitable corporations owned by some of the wealthiest people in the country and the world.
"""Donald Trump only views veterans and military families as political props to advance his own agenda."" - @Will_C_Fischer, Iraq War Veteran, @VoteVets"
"This morning, there will be a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. As I’ve said for years, it is time to end starvation wages in this country."
"Since 2011, I opposed the KeystoneXL pipeline. I feared that more dirty tar sands oil infrastructure would lead to disastrous spills. . . As 380,000 gallons of crude oil contaminate North Dakota's rural wetlands, we have got to say: Enough. It's time for a Green New Deal."
"It is a moral outrage that the wealthiest family in America, the Walton family, still refuses to pay workers at Walmart at least $15 an hour. Over the past 3 years, the Walton family became $84 billion richer, while Walmart's minimum wage has remained stuck at $11. Unacceptable."
"The rise of authoritarian nationalism is a challenge for all of us who support democratic values. Tomorrow at 11 AM I will deliver a speech at Johns Hopkins SAIS on the importance of ""Building a Global Democratic Movement to Counter Authoritarianism."""
"The financial sector grew fivefold as a share of the economy since the 1970s. . . The result? More greed, corruption, criminality, bloated CEO pay, financial crashes and taxpayer bailouts.. . Maybe Wall Street should face some downsizing so that the working class can finally thrive."
Republicans officials don't push the myth of voter fraud because it is an actual problem. They push it to maintain the racist voting laws that have kept them in power for generations. The real problem we face is voter suppression.
"My own personal view is that the Senate should ignore the parliamentarian’s advice, which is wrong in a number of respects. I am not sure, however, that my view at this point is the majority view in the Democratic Caucus."
Now is the #TimeToDeliver for the working class of this country.
"America loses when we become divided by religion, race, national origin or sexual orientation. We are stronger when we come together."
"Pfizer, which fired thousands of employees and gave executives huge raises after the last repatriation holiday, will get a $38.8 billion tax break."
"We must not only make public colleges tuition-free, but we must substantially reduce student debt in this country. It is absolutely absurd that millions of Americans are paying off debts for decades because they got a higher education."
"What are our priorities as a nation? Congress gives huge tax breaks to billionaires, while teachers in Oklahoma and other states are living on poverty-level salaries. Congratulations to the teachers in Oklahoma for standing up and fighting back."
It’s not enough to just respond with anger. We have to build a political movement in this country which says that that is not who we are and we will not tolerate that type of moral inadequacy.
"My colleagues and I are tired of endless wars. That is why we introduced the No War Against Iran Act. We must learn from our mistakes, not repeat them."
Student lunch debt should not exist. My bill with Rep. @Ilhan abolishes all of it.
I applaud the Israeli health officials for their efforts. Making sure all Palestinians receive vaccines is the right thing to do from both a public health and moral perspective. I hope the Israeli government follows their advice as quickly as possible.
"While the top 1% own twice as much wealth as the bottom 99% of humanity, 420 million people throughout the world are in danger of slipping into extreme poverty and 30 million children are at risk of dying from hunger. We cannot allow that to happen."
This is a full-blown crisis and Trump is only making it worse. . . Congress must demonstrate the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry and declare a climate emergency.
"While we set aside this day to recognize their service, we must commit ourselves to keep America’s promise to our veterans, just as they kept their promise to us."
We will take on climate change by transforming our energy systems toward renewable energy and energy efficiency. Through a Civilian Climate Corps we will give hundreds of thousands of young people good paying jobs and educational benefits as they help us combat climate change.
"Today is a victory for the largest and most profitable corporations in this country who, despite record-breaking profits, will now see hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks at the expense of working families."
"Instead of creating more giveaways to corporate America, we should be eliminating corporate tax loopholes and using this revenue to directly invest over $1 trillion to modernize our nation’s infrastructure and create 15 million good-paying jobs."
67% of the American people support universal pre-K.. 61% of the American people support tuition-free community college..  . We MUST invest in the future of our children. NOW.
"Today, 46 years after Roe v. Wade, abortion is a right in name only for millions of women in America. Our job: do everything we can to protect and expand reproductive rights and access to abortion across the country."

"On the 60th anniversary of John F. Kennedy’s famous speech and as a couple of billionaires look to exploit space for their own gain, let us not forget his proclamation that space advancements be “won and used for the progress of all people,” not just the wealthy few."
"Since 2009, 45% of all new income has gone into the hands of the wealthiest 1%. . . Is that acceptable to you?"
"Today, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major nation, our child care system is dysfunctional, our teachers are underpaid and many public schools are struggling. We need to invest in our kids, not a wall with Mexico."
Trump's disastrous plan to defund Social Security would eliminate retirement and disability benefits by 2023. We're not going to let that happen. We are going to protect and expand Social Security.
"I applaud the House of Representatives for passing the Stop War Against Iran Act that I introduced with @RepRoKhanna, and @RepBarbaraLee's repeal of the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force.. . The Senate must now take up these vital bills to stop endless war."
"Right now, phone lines of unemployment offices around the country are jammed and websites are crashing.. . The stimulus package just passed can provide real help to millions, but it won't matter unless the federal bureaucracy is able to implement the program and get the money out."
"⬆️In 1965, public college tuition was $2,000 a year. Now it’s $10,000.. . ⬇️In 1968 the minimum wage was $10. Now it’s $7.25.. . If we're not supposed to learn from other wealthy countries, we can sure as hell look at policies America had 50 years ago, when we were half as rich."
Thank you to those who showed up to the Senate yesterday to protest the horrific Republican tax bill. I hope my colleagues are listening.
Thank you to the thousands of people turning out today to protest Trump's cruel policy of separating families. The United States of America must never be about tearing apart families or locking up children in cages. #FamiliesBelongTogether
84% want to expand Medicare. . 83% want Medicare to lower drug prices. . 76% want to expand home healthcare. . 73% want paid family leave. . 71% want to tax the rich. . The American people have a right to know which side their Senator is on. It’s time to vote.
I'm on the Senate floor NOW calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza.

"Instead of listening to Sheldon Adelson and other multibillionaire campaign contributors, it is time to start listening to the overwhelming majority of Americans who want a government and an economy that works for the many—not just the few."
Alec Smith died trying to pay for a century-old drug that cost $6 to make and sold at $300..  . This is not a policy debate. It is a fight against the incredible corporate power of the pharmaceutical industry that is literally killing our people.
"Nurses are the backbone of our health care system. Yet, today, nurses are overworked and underpaid – and there aren't enough of them. I am working on legislation to address this crisis."
"Congratulations to Republican Senators Cory Gardner and Susan Collins for understanding that 800,000 federal employees must be paid. If Leader McConnell allows the Senate to vote, we can end the government shut down now."
Americans must not be forced to continue paying outrageously high and inflated prices for the medicine they need. Congress must stand up to the powerful pharmaceutical industry and substantially lower drug prices in this country.
I applaud President Biden for making the brave and right decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan and bring an end to the longest war in our country’s history.
"We must end a rigged system that allowed the former CEO of Gilead to become a billionaire by charging $1,000 for a Hepatitis C drug that was developed by the VA, costs $1 to manufacture & can be purchased in India for $4. No more excuses. Congress must lower drug prices NOW."
96 percent of Democrats and 83 percent of Republicans support background checks for all potential gun buyers. The gun lobby should not control Congress.
"President Trump’s record on the environment is pathetic and an embarrassment to the world. This is a man who still thinks climate change is a ""hoax."" He better start listening to scientists and not his friends in the fossil fuel, chemical, and big agribusiness industries."
The time is now to massively invest in our infrastructure and create millions of good-paying union jobs in the process.
What concerns me as much as anything is that half our people are living paycheck to paycheck. Millions of people are trying to survive on starvation wages. It’s morally imperative that we raise the minimum wage to a living wage that’s at least $15 an hour.
A multinational corporation taking huge sums of money from taxpayers should not be paying workers starvation wages. I stand with the workers who are fighting back against low wages and wage theft.
"Over the past 50 years:. . ⬆️ Real wages for the top 1% tripled. 🔝 The top 0.1% saw wages grow 450%. 📉 Pay for minimum-wage workers fell by 30%. . The solution is clear: End the obscene profiteering, and make all jobs pay a living wage of at least $15."
Here’s who wants Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices:. . 91% of Democrats. 85% of Independents. 76% of Republicans . 84% of seniors .  . It’s time to listen to the American people. Congress must finally have the courage to stand up to the greed of Big Pharma.
Widespread mask wearing could save tens of thousands of lives and $1 trillion in economic activity.. . @ASlavitt and I believe our government must lead the effort to produce and distribute high-quality masks for every American at no cost: Masks for All.
"The Walton family is worth $165.7 billion. Do we really need to have families in America worth more than $100 billion? . . When half of our people live paycheck to paycheck? . . Let us, together, have the courage to take on the greed of the corporate elite."
A recent poll found that 83% of Americans support allowing Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices..  . The American people are making themselves pretty clear. Congress needs to stand up to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry. Now is the time.
"This proposal belongs in the trash, @realDonaldTrump. No one should go hungry in the United States of America."
"During his campaign, Trump said over and over again that he would stick it to the wealthy by closing the egregious carried interest loophole. Guess what? His disgraceful tax bill did nothing to address it and even Fox Business commentators are fed up with his broken promises."
"President Trump’s press conference with Putin was an embarrassing spectacle. Rather than make clear that interference in our elections is unacceptable, Trump instead accepted Putin’s denials and cast doubt on the conclusions of our intelligence community. This is not normal."
"Today, we remember and celebrate the life of one of the great entertainers in modern American history. Aretha, thank you for all that you have given us. You will not be forgotten."
"If we are serious about spending taxpayer dollars wisely and effectively, we've got to end the absurdity of the Pentagon being the only agency in the federal government that has not passed an independent audit ever in the history of the country. That is the very least we can do."
The pharmaceutical industry doesn’t want us to lower the cost of prescription drugs.. The health care industry doesn’t want us to expand Medicare.. The fossil fuel industry doesn’t want us to tackle climate change. . . This is an enormous struggle. And we're going to win it.
"How can Trump not talk about the reality that Russia, through cyberwarfare, interfered in our election in 2016, is interfering in democratic elections all over the world, and according to his own CIA director will likely interfere in the 2018 midterm elections? #BernieResponds"
"Childhood poverty costs at least $500 billion annually in extra education, health and criminal justice expenses, and in lost productivity.. . Just think of all of the intellectual and emotional destruction that takes place in America because we ignore the needs of our children."
"If working people—the vast majority of our country—don't have income to spend on goods and services, we can't create jobs. . . There is a limit to how many limousines and yachts you can have. When so few have so much, it is not only a moral issue, it is also an economic issue."
"The workers’ struggle against Kellogg’s is a lot more than just 1,400 employees on strike in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Nebraska. . . It’s about what this country and our economy is supposed to stand for. I’m proud to stand with the workers."
Senate Republicans just gave a massive gift to Wall Street at the expense of everyone else.
How can a president of the United States give a State of the Union speech and not mention climate change? #SOTU
Starting soon: Sen. Sanders' response to #SOTU at
"My thoughts are with Erica Garner, her family and friends in hoping that she has a full recovery and rejoins the struggle for justice as soon as possible. I have had the privilege of joining with her at a number of events and was deeply impressed with her courage and insights."
Apply for spring internships in Senator Sanders' Vermont and Washington DC offices. The deadline to apply is Nov. 18. See here for more information:
"Trump tells us every day how much he hates immigrants and how much he loves American workers. But last year, Trump chose to hire only one American worker even though thousands of Americans wanted to work at his Mar-a-Lago resort. The rest were low-wage temporary guest workers."
"It is beyond belief that our health workers are putting their own lives on the line—risking infection—to care for the American people.. . We need the masks, gloves, gowns and workplace protections to keep health workers, their patients, and families safe."
"A worker making the federal minimum wage needs to work 99 hours a week, 52 weeks a year just to afford a modest one-bedroom apartment . . That is a national disgrace."
"In my view, it makes zero sense for Congress to hand a $52 billion check to the microchip industry, no strings attached. This is an industry that said ‘Hey, let’s throw hundreds of thousands of American workers out on the street to make more money in low-wage countries.’ Absurd."
"Let me be clear: it is a disturbing attack on the First Amendment for the Trump administration to decide who is or is not a reporter for the purposes of a criminal prosecution. Donald Trump must obey the Constitution, which protects the publication of news about our government."
"Methane emissions that fuel climate change are much larger than we thought.. . This is a moral issue. We must ban fracking—which harms our air, water and health. We can create millions of good jobs transforming our energy system to save our planet."
"Today, 50% of our people live paycheck to paycheck and half of older Americans have no savings. Meanwhile, CEOs of large corporations make a record-breaking 350 times what their workers earn..  . That level of inequality is immoral and unsustainable."
Mr. Trump is a lying bigot.
"By 2033, the United States is estimated to have a shortage of up to 139,000 physicians. That is what I mean when I say we’ve got a dysfunctional health care system."
"Thank you to the Congressional Progressive Caucus for their extraordinary effort in passing the American Rescue Plan, which is the most significant legislation for working people in the modern history of this country. Without them, this bill is not possible."
"Think of it. Instead of spending trillions on wars, strong U.S. presidential leadership could bring the world together in the fight against climate change and the need to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels."
"Trump’s border wall request: $8.6 billion. Tax cuts for the wealthy: $1.5 trillion. ""Space Force"" annual budget: $1.3 billion. Soccer and legal aid for children locked up at the border: $0.  . How obscene is it that this administration blames “budget pressures” to punish little kids."
"Next Monday, March 19th, we will be live streaming a discussion the likes of which you'd never see in the mainstream media. I hope you will tune in."
"When it comes to giving blank checks to profitable microchip companies, some of my colleagues think we should just “join the club” and do what other countries are doing. Well, there are a few other clubs I think we should join instead."
"With so many people facing economic desperation, Congress cannot recess until we pass a COVID-19 relief bill that includes at least $1,200 in direct payments for adults, $500 for kids, expanded unemployment benefits and emergency aid for states and cities to prevent mass layoffs."
Let us be clear. The Republican Party is refusing to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry which charges Americans by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. What a disgrace.
"The insurance companies and the drug companies have spent billions to protect their obscene profits by lying to the American people about Canada’s universal health care.. . Together, we will defeat their greed and guarantee health care as a human right."
The American people are being played for suckers. Congress must stand up to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry.
"While Trump and the GOP Senate don't believe we can afford to provide the working class another $1,200, they had no problem giving defense contractors $370 billion in corporate welfare to profit from endless war. Yes. That's socialism for the rich, rugged capitalism for the rest."
"The Cut, Cut, Cut Act:. ✅ Tax cuts for billionaires. ✅ Tax cuts for corporations . ✅ Forces cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security"
"The Framers gave the power to declare war to Congress, but over many years it has allowed its oversight authority to wane. We are LIVE introducing major legislation to reassert that constitutional power."
"Well, at least Trump is consistent. Abroad, he has never met a leader of an authoritarian nation (Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, Philippines) that he hasn't liked. At home he shows contempt for the U.S. Constitution and democracy."
"We are not going to win this fight unless all of us are actively involved, stand up, fight back and recognize that health care is a right, not a privilege. #MedicareForAll"
"The American people do not want war with Iran. They want to invest in health care, education, housing, and good jobs..  . Congress cannot stand by. It must act now to pass our legislation to uphold the Constitution and prevent Trump from spending trillions more on endless war."
"The Constitution and federal law bans indentured servitude. That means no worker, including federal employees, should be forced to work without getting paid. Trump's anti-worker government shutdown is an ugly attack on the working class of this country."
"Republicans control the House, Senate and White House. The most fundamental responsibility of the governing party is to govern. I say to Republicans: Do your job."
"At a time when over half of the people in this country live paycheck to paycheck, should we really be providing a multibillion-dollar taxpayer bailout for Bezos to fuel his space hobby? I don’t think so. The Senate will hold a vote this week to stop it."
"Four-year public university tuition in 1965 cost $1,926 a year. Today, it is $9,037 a year.. . Taxpayers paid for a trillion-dollar bailout to benefit the crooks on Wall Street.. . I think we can afford to make public colleges tuition-free and cancel all student debt."
"These deaths are what a broken immigration system is all about. Instead of demonizing immigrants, Trump should be meeting with Central American leaders to find ways to end the horrific violence and poverty that are forcing people to flee their homelands."
Trump and Judge Kavanaugh have two options. Trump can withdraw Judge Kavanaugh's nomination. Or Kavanaugh himself can call for an FBI investigation if he truly believes the allegations are false.
"What if the media told the American people every day that the richest 400 billionaires pay lower taxes than the middle class and the working poor? . . What if, when politicians say we must make do with less, the media admitted we're being played for"
Watch this progressive economist @lenorepalladino explain to Trump's chief economist how large corporations use stock buybacks to enrich their shareholders at the expense of workers.
"I find it very strange that President Trump has such a hard time getting along with the leaders of the world's major democracies but feels very comfortable with despots and authoritarian leaders like Putin, Xi Jinping, Duterte and Mohammad Bin Salman."
Pathetic. Trump’s attorneys still will not acknowledge that Trump lost the election. That’s what the Big Lie is all about.
"In just eight weeks, 36 million Americans lost their jobs. 27 million lost their health insurance.. . During the worst public-health crisis in a century, we cannot continue to tie health care to employment.. . Medicare must guarantee health care to all."
"Hey, Mr. President: Instead of copying France's military parade, why not copy France's health care system? Health care for all, low-cost prescription drugs, much less expensive."
Want to hear something really radical? The pharmaceutical industry can charge the American people $242 for the asthma inhaler – Flovent Diskus – that can be purchased for just $27 in Canada.
"I applaud this step by the Biden administration. The United States should lead the effort to vaccinate the world, not only by providing vaccines to poorer countries but also by helping to make the technology available for countries to produce it themselves."
We are the wealthiest country in the history of the world. How is it possible that 2 months after Hurricane Maria half the people of Puerto Rico don't have electricity?
The American people want fair elections. They do not want extreme gerrymandering. They do not want voter suppression. Period.
Goldman Sachs alone will get a $6 billion tax break from the Republican tax bill. That is a disgrace.
"While Amazon raised prices by up to 1,000% on masks, soap & toilet paper, Jeff Bezos became $88 billion richer and continues to deny workers paid sick leave & hazard pay. That is morally obscene. Billionaires should not be profiteering off a pandemic. #TaxTheRich"
"Extraordinary reporting by @JaneFerguson5, showing us pictures of the Yemen devastation that the Saudi coalition would rather we didn’t see. The US must stop supporting this catastrophic war. We cannot say we did not know."
4 Republican policies led to a $779 billion deficit in 2018:. . - Bush Tax Cuts: $488 B. - Trump Tax Cuts: $164 B. - Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan: $127 B. - Defense increases since 9/11: $156 B. . Without tax cuts for the wealthy and endless wars we would've had a $156 billion SURPLUS.
"The top 0.1% of Americans are already doing pretty well. But Republicans say they need even more. So they're giving them an average break of $208,000. Unbelievable. #TaxDebate"
"There is no rational reason, other than greed, for the pharmaceutical industry to charge the American people $98.70 for a standard unit of insulin that can be purchased in the United Kingdom for just $7.52."
We must achieve economic justice in this country — that means equal pay for equal work NOW.
No worker should be paid less than the minimum wage. It's time to end the subminimum wage and guarantee truly integrated employment opportunities for people with disabilities. I'm proud that my home state of Vermont has been a leader on this issue.
Trump talked about how he was going to take on the greed of Wall Street which he said “has caused tremendous problems for us.” Then he appointed more Wall Street billionaires to his administration than any president in history. #BernieResponds
"When the GOP controlled the Senate, they passed trillions in tax breaks largely to the top 1% and multinational corporations by a simple majority vote through reconciliation.. . We must use the same process to protect working families, the sick and the poor."
"In my view, it is long past time that we in the United States end the federal prohibition on marijuana. Now is the time to decriminalize marijuana and expunge criminal records associated with the drug."
During the first two+ months of the pandemic:. . Some Americans who lost poverty-wage jobs are receiving $600 a week in extra unemployment benefits. Republican response: How outrageous!. . 630 billionaires made $434 billion in profits. Republican response: Crickets.. . Tax the rich.
"This American woman experienced what it's like to have universal health care in the UK, and now she doesn't want to move back to the United States. (with @t1international)"
"I am disappointed but not surprised by the vote. It is extraordinarily courageous for workers to take on one of the world's wealthiest and most powerful corporations, a company that spent unlimited sums of money to defeat the organizing effort."
"Black women make 61 cents on the dollar compared to white men, and their wages continue to fall further and further behind. That is simply a disgrace.. . We should guarantee equal pay for equal work. This is not a radical idea—this is an issue of basic justice."
"If you really think that Verizon, Comcast, AT&T and Time Warner need more money, then you should be for repealing #NetNeutrality. - @RepRoKhanna"
"I agree with these 76 retired generals and admirals, who warn that a war with Iran would be a disaster for the region and for U.S. security, and who urge Trump to pursue diplomacy rather than an unnecessary conflict."
"We owe Native Americans an enormous debt. From the first days of this country, they were lied to, their treaties violated, and their needs ignored. Today, on Indigenous Peoples’ Day, let us recommit to standing with them in the fight for long overdue justice."
"In a rational society, an extremely contagious, deadly virus would get our government to finally pass universal paid sick leave for workers.. . Why hasn’t it happened yet? The power of big money over our politics."
"Big Oil has proven that it cannot operate without causing health, environmental, and economic crises. . . Our job: Ensure that oil workers have health care, pay, and pensions as we rapidly transition away from fossil fuels."
Three words: tax the wealthy.
Find out what happened to Jamal Khashoggi and holding the perpetrators accountable is more important than defense contractor profits. . . The time is long overdue for us to reevaluate the US-Saudi relationship and ask whether it's actually advancing our interests and values.
Does Senator Manchin believe that we should be the only major country on earth not to guarantee paid family and medical leave? And that working mothers should not be able to stay at home with a sick kid? Are workers not entitled to that?
"In 1968, Dr. King said “Now our struggle is for genuine equality, which means economic equality.”. . The minimum wage then was worth $10.15. Today, it’s $7.25.. . Our fight for human dignity must include making every job pay a living wage of at least $15 an hour. #MLKDay"
"Maybe, just maybe, in the richest country in the history of the world people should be able to afford the drugs prescribed by their doctor."
"Not only is Trump lying about Medicare for All. This president, who fought to throw 32 million Americans off of health insurance, is acting like he cares about health care for seniors or anyone else."
"As we come together to celebrate #NationalDoughnutDay, let me be perfectly clear: contrary to what you may hear from Fox News, Medicare for All will not limit your donut consumption.. . We cannot glaze over the fact that America does not guarantee health care as a human right."
"A one-time $1,200 check isn't nearly enough to make ends meet. Congress has a responsibility to make sure every working-class American receives a $2,000 emergency payment a month so they can pay their bills.. . The American people want action from Congress and they want it NOW."
"Today, the top 1% own more wealth than the bottom 92%. Since 2009, 45% of all new income has gone into the hands of the 1%.. . The time is long overdue for Congress to address the long-neglected needs of the working class."
Happy National Maple Syrup Day! Vermont is the biggest producer of maple syrup in America—producing nearly 2 million gallons of maple syrup last year alone. That's a lot of syrup.
"We need a revolution in education. Teachers in LA should not be forced to strike for decent wages and smaller classes. All parents deserve high quality, affordable childcare. Young people should not leave college deeply in debt. We must get our priorities right."
"There's no doubt in my mind that Sandra Bland, like too many African Americans who die in police custody, would be alive today if she were a white woman. I support her family’s call for a renewed investigation into her arrest and death."
"To truly honor Dr. King we must fight to carry out his radical and bold vision for racial and economic justice in America and transform our national priorities. The struggle continues to this day, and our work is far from over. #MLKDay"
"McConnell said he’d fill a Supreme Court vacancy in 2020 after blocking hearings for Merrick Garland. What a hypocrite. Make no mistake about it, McConnell's goal has always been the same: lifetime appointments for extreme rightwing judges by any means."
"Why do we spend more on the military than the next 11 nations combined? I have a better idea: Cut Pentagon spending by 10% and invest it in the fight to end homelessness, hunger and poverty in the richest country on Earth."
It is the right of all people to protest for a better future. The Egyptian government should refrain from violence against protesters exercising this right. The world is watching.
"I’m also very proud of @RepCori, @AOC and @USProgressives for leading the effort to push the federal government to respond directly to the needs of the working class."
"Until recently, there was no direct relief being considered for desperate, hungry people facing eviction.. . What I have fought for—with progressives and conservatives—is direct payments to the working class.. . We are making progress in Congress, but we must go much further."
"The Green New Deal is not radical, but let me tell you what is:. . A president who rejects science and calls climate change a hoax while unprecedented hurricanes batter the Gulf, wildfires rage in the west, an 800-mile derecho destroys towns and the Arctic melts.. . That's radical."
Even this Republican wants the government to stop spying on Americans.
We have got to act boldly to eradicate systemic racism and police violence. I am calling for sweeping policy reforms to protect people—particularly communities of color—who have suffered violence for far too long.
"The Reconciliation Bill is transformational. It's about taking on Pharma to lower prescription drug costs, the fossil fuel industry to combat climate change, the insurance companies to expand Medicare and demanding the rich pay their fair share. If we stand together, we win."
Ready for a really bad idea? Gut funding for studying and tracking climate change while boosting the continued burning of planet-warming fossil fuels.
"At a time when half of older Americans have zero retirement savings, we are not going to cut Social Security, as my Republican colleagues have proposed. We are going to expand Social Security and ensure everyone can retire with dignity. #ScrapTheCap"
What gives me hope right now are the new generations of young people who dream big and do not want to settle for the status quo.
Who on earth could have predicted that dismantling the White House pandemic office and cutting the Centers for Disease Control might leave us unprepared for this crisis?. . Pretty much everybody.
"This man's hospital bills for coronavirus cost $1.9 million.. . Meanwhile Mark Zuckerberg's wealth just surpassed $100 billion.. . During this crisis, we must tax billionaires' pandemic profits in order to guarantee free health care for all."
"This bill was far from perfect, and we must go much further. But Democrats did a good job standing up to Trump and McConnell to make sure this relief package got help to workers, small businesses, hospitals, and states and cities that desperately need it."
"This is about our priorities as Americans. All our people should get quality health care, higher education and child care. #CNNDebateNight"
"Israeli settlements in occupied territory are illegal. This is clear from international law and multiple United Nations resolutions. Once again, Mr. Trump is isolating the United States and undermining diplomacy by pandering to his extremist base."

"Mr. Trump's NAFTA 2.0 will not stop the outsourcing of jobs I warned against on the picket lines in 1993.. . We need a trade policy that ends the race to the bottom, not another one of Trump’s corporate giveaways."
"Under my legislation, the Opioid Crisis Accountability Act, Johnson & Johnson would be fined $7.8 billion—13 times as much as this penalty, about half of the company's profits, and 10 percent of the total annual cost of the terrible opioid crisis afflicting our country."
The United States incarcerates 2.2 million people and disproportionately incarcerates people of color. That has got to be addressed. Tune in tomorrow at 2:30 ET at for a discussion on criminal justice reform live from Philadelphia.
The wealthy and the powerful want you to think you are powerless. But we know that that's not the truth.
"There’s no crisis at the border but Trump’s shutdown is creating a crisis: The safety of the nation’s air travel system is at risk, tax refunds might not go out on time, national parks are overflowing with trash and hundreds of thousands of federal employees aren’t getting paid."
No one in this country should be afraid to go to the doctor because of cost amidst this horrific pandemic.. . We must empower Medicare to pay all of the medical bills of the uninsured and the under-insured.
Has corporate media paid enough attention to the issues affecting everyday Americans? Tune in to the discussion:
The richest 400 Americans sit on $3 trillion—the size of the entire UK economy..  . The billionaire class now pays a lower tax rate than people living paycheck to paycheck..  . The looting of America has been going on for over 40 years—and the culprits are the ultra-rich.
Mr. Trump and the GOP passed a tax scam two years ago. They said it would create jobs and boost wages.. . Big surprise: none of that happened—but who got richer? Their millionaire and billionaire donors.
"The number of huge profitable companies like Chevron and Netflix that are paying nothing in federal income taxes has doubled, because of Donald Trump's tax giveaways to the rich and large corporations. Nothing in federal income taxes.. . That is a disgrace."
"At a time when millions of workers are earning starvation wages, when the minimum wage has not been raised by Congress since 2007 and stands at a pathetic $7.25 an hour, it is time to raise the minimum wage to a living wage."
"If Republicans don't want to cooperate and help us seriously address the many crises we're facing today, then, yes, we have to move forward without them to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and create millions of good-paying, union jobs."
"68,000 Americans die each and every year because they cannot afford to get the health care that they need when they need it..  . In other words, the greed of the prescription drug industry is killing Americans."
"Today, 18 million households spend 50 percent of their limited incomes on housing. How does that make any sense?. We must build low-income and affordable housing, and when we do that, we will create a heck of a lot of good-paying jobs."
Our bill only applies to the richest 0.2% of Americans. It would establish a:. . -45% tax on estate values $3.5M to $10M. -50% tax on estate values $10M to $50M. -55% tax on estate values over $50M. -77% tax on estate values over $1 billion
"When you have the most powerful nation on earth saying that it is acceptable to tear children from the arms of their parents, you are sending a signal to countries around the world that this is how they can treat immigrants and minorities. That is a very dangerous signal."
States and cities handed out free cash to huge corporations but saw no new economic growth..  . Trickle-down economics was a success. Congratulations to the millionaires and billionaires who made out like bandits. You guys won.
"My colleagues seem to be so concerned with the deficit when it comes to addressing the needs of working people, but all of a sudden forget about the deficit when we're talking about an annual defense budget of $778 BILLION. What hypocrisy."
"No, Mr. President. Dr. Ford's allegations are not a ""con job."" We believe her. Brett Kavanaugh does not belong on the Supreme Court."
"Terrence Wise is 39 years old, works two jobs at Burger King and McDonald’s, and still has had to deal with homelessness.. . In the richest country on Earth, that is immoral.. . Nobody in America can survive on $7.25 an hour. All of our workers must earn at least a $15 living wage."
"It is insane that our nurses are being forced to care for the sick without masks and respirators. The Department of Labor must immediately issue emergency workplace standards to protect our health workers, their families, and their patients."
"I call on Mitch McConnell to conduct a full and fair trial to hold this president accountable, and I am fully prepared to uphold my responsibility as a juror in the United States Senate."
"Last year, 4 members of the Walton family of Walmart made $12.7 billion in 1 day.. . It would take a full-time Walmart worker making $11/hr over 653,000 years to make that much.. . Thursday, @RepRoKhanna and I are introducing legislation to make Walmart pay its workers a living wage."
"In the richest country in the history of the world, 13 million children live in poverty and two-thirds of them are children of color. This is a moral outrage. If we raise the minimum wage and invest in education and housing, we can end child poverty."
"It is obvious Secretary DeVos wants to dismantle and privatize public education. No wonder she calls unions and local governments an ""empire"" to defeat. Our communities need an advocate for public education, not a billionaire advancing the interests of for-profit industry."
"About 70% of Puerto Rico still has no power, as many as 900 could be dead and thousands need food, shelter and clean water. We must help."
Are Republicans telling the truth about Canadian health care? These Canadian patients have the answers:
"The U.S. has a president who is so ""tough"" that he can order tiny kids to be torn from their parents' arms. Unfortunately, he's not so tough that he can speak out on human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia. Wouldn't it be nice if we had a leader who sounded more like @JustinTrudeau."
"Over 50 years, the bottom half's annual income only grew by $8,000. Today, 50% of America makes $27,000 a year..  . 📈But the top 1%'s income tripled, to $1,000,000 a year.. 📈Top 0.1% grew 400%—to $5,000,000.. 📈Top 0.01% grew 500%—to $24,000,000..  . We need a political revolution."
Jane and I are deeply saddened to hear that Vermonter Sandy Casey was among the victims in Vegas. Our hearts are with her friends & family.
"If you were wondering how Trump plans to pay for his tax cuts for billionaires and corporations, now you know: with $1.8 trillion in cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security."
"11) So, the question that must be asked is why would the corporate media would put their blind faith in a far right-wing economist whose past reports have been so thoroughly discredited by mainstream economists and experts?"
Republicans love talking about how Reagan enacted a major tax cut in 1981. They fail to mention he raised taxes 10 times thereafter.
Happy Mother's Day to Jane and all the mothers of this country.
"How the hell can two people be charged $200 or $6,400 for the same test?. . No rational person can accept our dysfunctional, profit-driven health care system.. . No more greed. It's time to make health care a human right. It's time to pass Medicare for All."
"Ending the estate tax would give a tax break of up to $63 billion to the Walton family and $39 billion to the Kochs—but $0 to 99.8% of Americans.. . At a time of record inequality, the very last thing we should do is line the pockets of the rich."
"After mismanaging a deadly pandemic, Trump and Senate Republicans now want to ram through a Supreme Court nominee who will vote to destroy the Affordable Care Act, kick millions off their health care, and eliminate protections for preexisting conditions.. . An absolute outrage."
Lying to Congress is a federal crime.. . The FBI must examine the veracity of Kavanaugh’s statements under oath in addition to the sexual assault allegations against him. Kavanaugh's truthfulness with the Senate goes to the very heart of whether he should be confirmed to the court.
"Home health aides, mostly women of color, do enormous work caring for our elderly. Yet they are insanely overworked and get poverty pay. Almost half need public assistance. . . What they need are the living wages and benefits they are entitled to in America."
"-40 million Americans still live in poverty. -30 million have no health insurance. -Half of older workers have no retirement savings. . And what does Trump's tax plan accomplish? Make the very, very rich much richer. What a disgrace."
"It is expensive to raise kids, and working class parents are struggling. By expanding the Child Tax Credit we have helped millions of families and are cutting childhood poverty by 45%. A great accomplishment. Yet, not one Republican will vote to extend that program. Pathetic."
My colleagues @RepJayapal and @Ilhan are joining me to answer your questions on how we will #CancelStudentDebt. . . How does it work? How is it paid for? This is a crisis that we can solve if we have the political will. Watch live:
"This is a health crisis that no one is talking about it. If Congress does not act soon to fund the Community Health Center program, 2,800 health centers will close their doors."
"Republicans want to increase defense spending by more than $150 billion over the next 2 years.. . Meanwhile, this same Republican Party hasn't reauthorized spending for the Children's Health Insurance Program or Community Health Centers."
"No surprise. Insurance and drug companies oppose Medicare for All. They make billions in profits from our dysfunctional system and pay their CEOs outrageous amounts.. . But we have the people on our side. They understand we must guarantee health care as a right, not a privilege."
"Over fifty years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. warned us that “a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.”. . That is what our amendment is all about."
"Think big, not small. It is not ""radical"" to demand that all Americans receive decent wages, guaranteed health care, quality education, affordable housing and a clean environment. We need a government that represents all of us, not just the 1%."
"What if — and stick with me for a minute, because this is a pretty far out concept to some of my Republican colleagues in Washington – what if we spent as much money helping the working class of this country as we do on our nation’s military?"
What Trump and his friends in the fossil fuel industry are doing is criminal.
"In Chile, a billionaire president pushes austerity while the military represses protesters. Thousands have been arrested. Knowing Chile's history, this is very dangerous..  . The solution here and across the world is obvious. Put power where it belongs: with working people."
"Sen. Sanders is seeking a full-time, paid press/video fellow. See here for details:"
"Trump gave the top 1% and large corporations $1 trillion in tax breaks. Now, he wants to repeal the Estate Tax and make his billionaire friends even richer. Wrong! At a time of massive wealth inequality, the very rich must pay their fair share of taxes."
"Cut the Pentagon. Feed, shelter, educate, and employ all our people."
"President Trump, We don’t need to create artificial crises. We have enough real ones. Let us end this shutdown and bring the American people together around an agenda that will improve life for all of our people. #BernieResponds"
The Republicans are so desperate to spin their disastrous tax plan that they have resorted to taking comments I recently made completely out of context. Let me set the record straight.
"As we finally honor Juneteenth as a federal holiday, we must never forget the horrors of slavery and how they affect every aspect of our lives today."
"We must not be about forcing over 10 million undocumented people, many of whom have been here for decades, to continue living in fear and anxiety. Congress must do what the American people want. Let us create a humane and rational immigration system."
"The issue about Amazon is not just that the wealthiest person on earth, Jeff Bezos, is paying workers unlivable wages. It's about the ""new economy"" and the degradation of the human spirit—breaking down people, spitting them out and simply replacing them with new bodies."
Tomorrow I'll move to proceed to the resolution I've offered with @SenMikeLee and @ChrisMurphyCT to end US involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen. I am optimistic that a bipartisan coalition will vote to make clear we will no longer support Saudi Arabia in its destructive war.
"Happy 4th of July! Let us recommit today to building a future that works for all of us, not just the few."
"President Trump is an unindicted co-conspirator in a crime. We should not confirm his Supreme Court justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a man who believes the president cannot be indicted or deposed."
"Here is a New Year's Resolution I hope you will share with me. In 2018, we will not only intensify the struggle against Trumpism, we will increase our efforts to spread the progressive vision in every corner of the land."
It's not just Democrats and Independents. More Republicans support allowing Dreamers to stay in the country than support building a wall. It couldn't be clearer what Congress needs to do.
Now is the time to lower the Medicare eligibility age.
"If Jeff Bezos can afford a $500 million yacht, a $23 million mansion with 25 bathrooms and a rocket ship to blast a comedian to outer space, you know what? Amazon can afford to give its employees a $3 raise. I stand in strong solidarity with the Amazon workers walkout."
"Donald Trump, who has a very difficult time telling the truth about anything, is lying about Medicare for All. . . Our proposal wouldn't cut benefits for seniors. In fact, we expand benefits, eliminate deductibles and copays and lower the cost of prescription drugs."
"Congratulations to Elle Purrier St. Pierre of Montgomery, Vermont on qualifying for the Olympics. Elle, a graduate of Richford High School and UNH, is headed to the summer games in Tokyo after breaking a 32-year-old record in the 1,500 meters Olympic trials."
"In this country, there is an understanding that the level of income and wealth inequality we have now is unsustainable and immoral. The time is long overdue to demand the wealthiest people and the largest corporations in America start paying their share of federal income taxes."
"An MRI scan costs $1,420 in America. It runs $450 in the UK.. . A U.S. angioplasty costs $32,200. In the Netherlands, it's $6,400.. . Other major countries cover all their people and pay half of what we do. Don't tell me we can't afford Medicare for All."
"I am proud to have worked with @USProgressives in the House to challenge the devastating cuts to education, health care and pensions imposed on the people of Puerto Rico. I applaud @RepRaulGrijalva for hosting a hearing to chart a just and equitable way forward."
"""36,000 people died in the United States in 2016 as a result of being uninsured."" –Dr. Claudia Fegan #MedicareForAll"
What is it like to live in a country with universal health care?
The president’s veto enables the sale of $8.1 billion in weapons sales to Saudi Arabia's brutal dictators. It will deepen and prolong the world's worst humanitarian crisis in Yemen. It infringes on Congress' authority over matters of war.. . What a disgrace.
"A half million people in Oregon evacuate as wildfires rage. Over 3 million acres in California burned. The western sky is red. An 800-mile derecho destroyed towns in Iowa. The Arctic topped 100 degrees. . . The Green New Deal has been called ""expensive."" . . Compared to what?"
"The reason I voted against today’s continuing resolution is simple: tens of millions of lives are at stake. We must act NOW, not kick the can down the road."
This is what Oligarchy and Authoritarianism is all about. Putin is not only destroying Ukraine and the Russian economy. He is now in the process of ending the last vestiges of Russian democracy and free speech.
"Pope Francis is right. We must reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and transform our energy system to renewable energy. If we do not, the consequences will be catastrophic."
"This country was built by immigrants. The American people want comprehensive, humane immigration reform.. . We must reverse these Trump programs which are designed to demonize and hurt those who are the most vulnerable of all."
It’s been over 10 years since the federal minimum wage was raised to $7.25 an hour and over 100 days since the House passed the Raise the Wage Act. No American should be in poverty. Workers need a living wage. Mr. McConnell: do your duty and bring the bill to the Senate floor.
"Here is my question for Trump: what are you afraid of?. . If you are not guilty of abuse of power, you should welcome testimony from your former national security advisor and other witnesses.. . If you did nothing wrong, then join me in calling for a full and fair impeachment trial."
Enough is enough. The American people are sick of large corporations making record profits as millions are living paycheck to paycheck. . . Join me TODAY at 11 a.m. ET for a hearing in the Budget Committee to discuss how corporate greed and profiteering are fueling inflation.
"President Obama is absolutely right. It is an outrage that modern-day poll taxes, gerrymandering, I.D. requirements, and other forms of voter suppression still exist today. If expanding the Voting Rights Act requires us to eliminate the filibuster, then that is what we must do."
Less than 0.004% of fully vaccinated people had a breakthrough case that led to hospitalization and less than 0.001% of fully vaccinated people died from a breakthrough Covid-19 case. GET VACCINATED.
"We are at a historic moment. Do we turn our backs on working families who are hurting like they have never hurt before? Or do we provide them with the help they need?. . Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans are turning their backs. Enough! Let the Senate vote on $2,000 checks!"
"Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the world and Amazon is worth more than a trillion dollars.. . Workers there should not be 3 times more likely to be injured on the job. Bathroom breaks should not be considered ""time off task."" Amazon's warehouse conditions are intolerable."
"Jeff Bezos, the richest person on the planet, won’t be joining our hearing this morning on income and wealth inequality. But Jennifer Bates, who works at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama, will testify about the need to build an economy that works for all of us."
"While Trump believes we can't afford to extend $600 a week to 30 million unemployed workers, he had no problem giving a $688 million bailout to defense contractors like Rolls-Royce not to build more masks and more gowns, but to build more warships and more drones. How Pathetic."
Antroinette's daughter Antavia died because she had to ration her insulin—something that should never happen again in the wealthiest country in the world. Pharma's greed is literally killing people in this country and they must be stopped.
"Outrageous. Instead of spending hundreds of millions of dollars on dividends to enrich wealthy shareholders, Caterpillar, Black & Decker, Levi Strauss and other corporations should be using this money to compensate the thousands of workers they laid off."
"Tim Scott says he wants hardworking, everyday Americans to get ahead. So I hope he will vote against the disastrous GOP tax bill. #TaxDebate"
Do not tell me that a Green New Deal is “radical.” What’s radical is doing nothing to stop climate change while the Arctic is on fire.
"Congratulations to the students pushing the University of California to join more than a thousand institutions in divesting from fossil fuels. If we want to leave future generations a planet that is healthy and habitable, we must transform our energy system to sustainable energy."
"Thank you to the many, many people who attended and watched our groundbreaking Solving Our Climate Crisis town hall last night, as well as our terrific panelists. . . This was just the beginning of a movement to protect the planet and create millions of jobs. #ClimateTownHall"
"How crazy is this? Even though car makers agreed with California to keep stronger fuel efficiency standards, the EPA is proposing to allow more tailpipe pollution. Trump's loyalty to the fossil fuel industry is threatening the very lives of our children."
Join me @SenWarren to talk about where we go from here in the fight against the Republican tax bill and what our priorities should really be.
Dental care is health care. All Americans must have the right to see a dentist without going into debt.
"Our job is to be bold. Our job is to think very big and to go forward in a moral struggle that says: we will protect our planet, not just for our own children but for all the children of the world. #ClimateTownHall"
The situation in Gaza is desperate. The unrest in Gaza will not end until the people there see hope for a decent future. The U.S. must work to bring Israel and the Palestinians together to end the blockade and develop policies that works for all.
"It is time we become a nation that is based on the principles of justice and compassion, not greed and oligarchy."
"I know that Trump is not much into history or the U.S. Constitution, but he ought to know that millions of men and women have struggled, fought and died to defend our democracy and the religious freedom that our Constitution guarantees."
"Community health centers save lives, but they also save money. They’ve generated $49 billion in savings to the entire health care system."
"While wealthy people quarantine in the luxury of their summer homes, low-income workers are being forced to go back to work and put their lives on the line..  . This virus has grossly exposed the inequities of our economic system."
Trump’s deal with China won't fix a failed trade policy that has destroyed 3.7 million U.S. jobs. I am proud to have voted against the disastrous 2000 China trade agreement. We need a trade policy that stops giant corporations from shipping jobs overseas and polluting our planet.
"Richard Trumka was a son of the American working class, and he never forgot where he came from. Over the years he and I worked together on many issues. He was a friend and I am saddened by his passing. Jane and I send our deepest condolences to the Trumka family."
"Watch Canadian doctor @docdanielle respond to the pathetic myth that single-payer health care is a ""Big Brother-style"" government takeover:"
It is time for @realDonaldTrump to listen to the 92% of voters who want full federal funding for the Postal Service.. . The Post Office is delivering medicine to millions of Americans during a pandemic. We will not allow it to be bankrupted or privatized.
"We must repeal the Trump tax breaks for the top 1% and large, profitable corporations. At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, we need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and create a sustainable economy, not make the very rich even richer."
"The wealthiest top 1% owe 70 percent of unpaid taxes. If we collected less than a third of that, we could pay for universal nutritious school meals for children.. . Do not tell me kids have to go hungry at school in the richest country in the world."
I’m standing in solidarity today with the brave McDonald’s workers on strike to demand the company finally address the epidemic of sexual harassment.
"Today, I will be going to the floor of the Senate to demand that the Senate pass a $2,000 direct payment to every working class American in this country. What would a $2,000 direct payment mean to you?"
"On this Labor Day, let us not forget that the total wealth of the top 1% reached a record $45.6 trillion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. That’s more money than the bottom 90% of our country. We need an economy that works for all, not just the few."
The people of Denmark are some of the happiest on earth. I met with @DanJoergensen of Denmark's Social Democratic Party (@Spolitik) to learn why.
"For the last 4 years, Trump has said exactly the same thing. Unfortunately, he's a pathological liar & the only plan he has is to repeal the ACA, take healthcare away from 20 million and end protections for pre-existing conditions. That's 1 more reason why Trump must be defeated."
"It is truly outrageous that at the very same time the Santa Clarita school shooting was happening, Senate Republicans—led by Mitch McConnell—refused to pass gun safety legislation.. . Congress and Trump must finally have the courage to stand up to the NRA. Enough is enough!"
"President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh will be a rubber-stamp for an extreme, right-wing agenda pushed by corporations and billionaires. We must mobilize the American people to defeat Trump’s right-wing, reactionary nominee."
"House Republicans: ""If you take out a loan, you pay it back."". . Meanwhile: 13 House Republicans took out over $15 million in PPP loans that were totally forgiven by the federal government.. . House Republicans: If you take out a loan, you pay it back."
Congratulations to the advocates who fought to pass this landmark bill to radically cut New York State’s carbon pollution and transform its energy system. This is a step in the right direction toward the type of bold action on climate change that we need.
"It is a horror beyond words that Shane Patrick Boyle died because he fell $50 short of raising the money he needed for insulin.. . Insulin was discovered in 1923 and was sold for $1. No one should beg, ration, go bankrupt, or die over it.. . This is why we are taking on Big Pharma."
The racist and homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett is a horrific instance of the surging hostility toward minorities around the country. We must come together to eradicate all forms of bigotry and violence.
40% of fast-food workers have reported experiencing sexual harassment. That is simply unacceptable. . . We must stand with the brave McDonald’s workers walking out today to demand the company address this epidemic of sexual harassment.
More proof that this administration wants to rig the 2020 Census to undercount minorities—and they’re trying to cover it up. The census must not be turned into a partisan weapon. Immigrant communities have a right to equal representation and funding.
88% believe we should lower prescription drug costs. 84% think we should expand Medicare. 73% support establishing Paid Family and Medical Leave. 67% want universal Pre-K.  . Here's a radical idea - let's listen to the American people. Let's get it done.
How does it happen that the pharmaceutical companies can charge any price they want for prescription drugs? . . The answer is clear: The prescription drug industry is one of the most powerful political forces in America.
“Bump stocks” provide an effective workaround to convert a legal weapon into an illegal one. We need to ban them and save lives.
"Today, on Holocaust Remembrance Day, we pledge to never forget the 6 million Jews murdered by Hitler. At a time of increased tribalism and xenophobia, we must recommit ourselves to fight against all forms of bigotry and intolerance."
1 out of 5 Americans cannot afford the medication they need.. . Pharmaceutical executives must be held accountable for the massive price-fixing scheme they have concocted to jack up the price of life-saving prescription drugs.
Donald Trump made $694 million in 2016. That means he stopped paying Social Security taxes 40 minutes into the year.. . Meanwhile a middle-class worker paid Social Security taxes the entire year.. . I say to Trump: pay your fair share. Let's scrap the cap and expand Social Security.
I’m shocked! @FoxNews actually gets it right! This budget bill is going to transform the lives of millions of people.
We don't need more nuclear weapons. We don't need more fighter jets.. . We do need decent housing and health care for our people.
"Nearly two-thirds of our seniors have no dental insurance and no idea how they will afford to go to a dentist. That is a disgrace, and it must end."
"Maybe, just maybe, at a time of massive income and wealthy inequality, when two people own more wealth than the bottom 40%, now is the time to address the needs of our people."
The fact that ZERO Republicans are supporting a resolution to back free elections in Brazil tells us about the state of democracy in this country and the Republican Party. I’ll be LIVE on the Senate floor tonight at 7:15 p.m. ET to talk about it.
"This is not a case of sending American troops there. They are already there and Trump is withdrawing them, giving the Turkish Army permission to invade.. . Kurdish fighters have fought and died in our joint effort to eliminate ISIS. They should not be abandoned in this way."
"At a time of exploding profits, I would hope that @Amazon would pay everyone who works in your fulfillment centers a living wage. Thank you very much for your invitation to visit a fulfillment center. I look forward to doing that. Let’s work out a mutually convenient time."
Jane and I want to take this opportunity to wish you and yours a safe and healthy new year. 2022 is not a time for despair or cynicism. Now is a time for hard work. Now is a time to stand up and fight for the country that we know we can become.
$2.5 billion in federal funding went to Moderna. The company’s CEO then received a $926 million golden parachute. Does that make any sense to you?
"At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, the American people are demanding that large, profitable corporations pay their fair share of taxes and treat their employees with the dignity and respect they deserve. That is what this legislation will begin to do."
"Mr. Trump, watch these Patriotic Millionaires explain how to stimulate the economy. It's not by giving massive tax breaks to your billionaire friends."
"If a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist. . . Join me live as we introduce our bill to break up the largest banks in America:"
"Trump said he would “always protect your Medicare and Social Security. Always.” Today, his budget is cutting them by hundreds of billions of dollars.. . I will do everything in my power to ensure that Congress rejects this budget of, for, and by the 1%."
This former Apple software engineer is calling out his former company for spending $100 billion in stock buybacks after saving billions of dollars from the Republican tax scam.
"I applaud Ecuador’s Indigenous-led grassroots movements who stood up to repression and blocked the IMF's austerity agenda. . . Economic elites keep pushing austerity worldwide, making life unbearable for working people. The U.S. should stop supporting this."
"No national testing program. No adequate production of protective gear. No commitment to a free vaccine..  . As almost every major country sees the spread of coronavirus decline, America's infections are spiking..  . Trump's incompetence is killing people."
"Donald Trump rants against undocumented immigrants, and wants to spend billions on a wall to keep them out. Yet, surprise, surprise. Trump's golf clubs and resorts have knowingly hired low-wage undocumented workers for years. What a fraud!"
"The fight for Medicare for All will be opposed by some of the most powerful forces in our country. Like most movements, this fight will not be without struggle. But the American people are clear in demanding a system that guarantees health care to every man, woman and child."
"Let your friends, family and co-workers know. If Trump nominates a right-wing reactionary to the Supreme Court, as is widely expected, we must mobilize the American people to defeat that nomination."
"We have got to think big, not small. Canada guarantees free health care for all, Finland provides free tuition at public colleges, France provides generous retirement benefits. We are the wealthiest country on Earth. Why can't we do the same?"
The Senate just took an important step toward reversing the Trump administration’s disastrous decision to repeal #NetNeutrality. Now the House must side with the 86% of Americans who support net neutrality and pass this resolution to protect our free speech and democracy.
"I condemn Trump's reckless decision to abandon our Kurdish allies to their fate at the hands of Turkish President Erodogan.. . The President of the United States should not make significant national security decisions impulsively, by tweet, after a single phone call."
"In the capital of the world's richest country, Black mothers die at a higher rate than in Panama or Ecuador. That is obscene.. . Medicare for All means means comprehensive prenatal care, professional child delivery, and reproductive health services for all."
"Last night, President Trump received a standing ovation from a group of farmers after he told them they would no longer have to pay the estate tax. He forgot to mention that less than 0.1 percent of estate taxes are paid by small farmers."
"This merger represents a gross concentration of power that runs counter to the public good. At a time when our telecommunications and media industries are already too concentrated, we should be focused on opening those markets to more competition, not less."
"Rusty Williams says medical cannabis helped him get through chemotherapy and saved his life. We should be allowing states to move forward with legalization efforts, not interfering with the great progress that has been made."
"We are in a crisis never before faced by a rich, industrialized democracy. Our people are dying sooner and sooner, many out of despair.. . If we do not end the pain and suffering of millions of Americans, we will condemn an entire generation to early death."
"The ruling class of this country is nervous. They know more and more people are realizing they have the right to live in peace, the right to live with dignity. And that is a very real threat to their greed."
"Number of people who have no health insurance:.  . 🇰🇷South Korea: 0. 🇨🇦Canada: 0. 🇹🇼Taiwan: 0. 🇯🇵Japan: 0. 🇩🇪Germany: 0. 🇸🇬Singapore: 0. 🇺🇸United States: 30,000,000.  . Now, more than ever, we need a universal, Medicare for All, single-payer health care system."
"The organizing victory at Amazon on Staten Island is a signal that American workers will no longer accept exploitation. They're tired of working longer hours for lower wages. They want an economy that works for all, not just Jeff Bezos. Congratulations to @amazonlabor."
"No, Mr. President. We are not going to postpone the presidential election. Read the Constitution (for once). On Nov. 3, the American people will decide upon your disastrous administration and reject your authoritarianism, lies and racism. You will lose. Bye, bye."
It is insane to open up a National Wildlife Refuge to provide more handouts to wealthy fossil fuel corporations. #ProtectTheArctic
"At a time of massive crises facing working families, my Republican colleagues have suddenly become very concerned about the deficit. That's funny. I didn't hear these concerns when they passed trillions in tax breaks for the rich & a blank check for endless wars. What hypocrisy!"
"Under a Medicare for All system, we are going to guarantee health care to all people as a human right. Working people should not have to search around for coupons or risk going into bankruptcy to afford their medical care."
"1 in 7 kids will go hungry in America today.. . Under Trump, 91 of our richest companies pay $0 in corporate taxes.. . If they paid their 21% tax, we'd have the funds to end childhood hunger in America.. . We must take on corporate power if we want a decent society for our children."
The end of net neutrality would be a disaster for our country and the free flow of ideas. But this fight is not over. Here's what's at stake and how we can save net neutrality:
The Trump administration has shown once again that it is on the wrong side of history. There is a reason the administration has not provided any scientific evidence to justify this policy: there is no justification for this sort of discrimination.
Jeff Bezos has seen his wealth go up by $34 billion since March 12th.. . The least he could do is provide two weeks of universal paid sick leave and respect the right of workers to organize. I stand in solidarity with Amazon Workers International.
"Why is it that in the richest country in the history of the world we leave our seniors to suffer? We must expand Medicare to cover eyeglasses, hearing aids and dental."
This Republican mayor leads the first city in Texas powered by 100% renewable energy. Addressing climate change and creating millions of good-paying jobs in the process should not be a partisan issue.
"If Disney can afford to lavish its CEO with over $100 million, it can and it must pay all of its workers a living wage."
"The GOP claims to be the party of the working class. Yet, the head of the GOP campaign arm released a plan to raise taxes on half of Americans while imposing massive cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and education. Oh, yeah. They sure LOVE working people. No doubt."
"Social distancing can be impossible for our homeless, who are among the most vulnerable during this pandemic.. . We cannot talk about the necessity of staying at home if we are not committed to making housing a human right."
"Today, 72 Members of Congress made it clear that it would be an outrage to attach Sen. Manchin's fossil fuel ""side deal"" to the Continuing Resolution or any other must pass bill. At a time when our planet is on fire, we must take on the greed of Big Oil & reject this dirty deal."
"OPEC's decision to cutback on production is a blatant attempt to increase gas prices at the pump that cannot stand. We must end OPEC's illegal price-fixing cartel, eliminate military assistance to Saudi Arabia, and move aggressively to renewable energy."
The death penalty is cruel and unusal punishment. It must be abolished.
One of the greatest political crises we face is voter suppression. Our job: fight back. Defend voting rights. Create a vibrant democracy.
"Even after the devastation caused by Hurricane Ida, my Republican colleagues will say combatting climate change is too expensive. . . I ask again: compared to what? More flooding, power outages, droughts, heat waves, and extreme weather events? We need transformative change NOW."
"The fossil fuel industry is now the equivalent of the tobacco industry. It creates death and destruction, then spends billions denying its responsibility..  . Let us be clear: Hurricane Dorian has everything to do with climate change, which is the existential crisis of our time."
"Maybe it's a radical idea in Washington, but no. I do not believe that the billionaire class should pay a lower effective tax rate than the middle class. A profitable corporation like Zoom should not be able to pay nothing in federal income taxes when its profits go up by 4,000%."
"Together, we will cancel all student debt. And we're going to make Wall Street speculators pay for every nickel of it."
"I think the average American, whether you’re Democrat, Republican, or Independent, can agree there is something absurd about two people owning more wealth than the bottom 40% of America and billionaires paying NOTHING in federal income tax."
"Billionaires got their tax breaks last month, but for 113 days health insurance for 9 million children has been hanging in the balance."
"The idea that we treat health care as an employee benefit is totally absurd.. . As millions are losing their jobs, my bill with @RepJayapal says: We will take a burden off your shoulders. In this crisis, you will get all the health care you need for free."
Here’s a New Year's resolution for Mitch McConnell: Stop obstructing and do your job.. . 67% want a $15 minimum wage. 88% want universal background checks on guns. 77% say it’s unfair to pay women less than men. . Let the Senate vote on bills supported by the vast majority of America.
"20 years later, we pause to remember the thousands of lives lost on September 11, 2001, and the bravery of so many first responders who put their lives at risk to save others."
"Congratulations on this historic confirmation, Secretary @DebHaalandNM!"
"Today is a sad day in history: the beginning of an impeachment trial for the President.. . It would be absurd to have a trial at 1 o'clock in the morning without any witnesses.. . I say to Senator McConnell: hold a fair trial with witnesses, in full view of the American people."
"The real unemployment rate is over 20%—the highest since the Great Depression. No, Mr. Trump, this is not the time to take a victory lap. . . The government must guarantee 100% of the paychecks and benefits of American workers up to $90,000/year. Pass the Paycheck Security Act now."
"We are BEGINNING to create an economy that works for all. But more must be done. We must raise the minimum wage to $15, provide health care for all, lower prescription drug costs, forgive student debt and demand the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share of taxes."
I believe that we have become far too comfortable with the United States engaging in military interventions all over the world. We need to ask this very hard question: is a perpetual war necessary to keep us safe?
"If Republicans want to work with us to address this unprecedented economic crisis, welcome—let’s do it.. . But we cannot wait weeks and weeks, and months and months, to provide relief to the American people.. . We have got to act now, and that’s exactly what we’re doing."
5 states have now passed legislation increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour. I congratulate the Vermont Senate for doing the same. . . Let's make sure every worker in Vermont and throughout the country has the right to a living wage.
"Walmart insists it can't afford to pay workers $15/hr. Really? The Walton family, which owns Walmart, is the richest family in America—worth around $167 billion.. . Walmart: do the right thing. Raise your minimum wage to a living wage of $15/hr. #BlackFriday"
"This is outrageous: Nurses are being forced to stop critical procedures for patients because of the insurance industry. Medicare For All would give power back to health professionals, where it belongs."
"It is absolutely unacceptable that hundreds of thousands of bright young Americans do not get a higher education each year, not because they are unqualified, but because their family does not have enough money."
Our Founding Fathers understood that it was only too easy for a president to lead the country into a disastrous military conflict. That is why they gave the exclusive power over war and peace to the people’s elected representatives.
Grocery store workers put their lives on the line every day to keep us fed during this pandemic. They are heroes. They deserve more than empty gestures from the corporations exploiting them—they deserve hazard pay and the protective gear they need.
"The science is clear: if we do not address climate change now, we will suffer greater and more frequent climate disasters and the Earth will become increasingly uninhabitable. .  . It’s time we listen to scientists, not the fossil fuel industry."
"How absurd is it that the Republicans who tell us over and over how much they care about “freedom” are also defending book burning, homophobia and racism. That is not what ""freedom"" is about. That's authoritarianism and bigotry."
"Let me ask you a question. Does it make sense to you that in America today, 2 billionaires own more wealth than the bottom 40% and the top 1% owns more wealth than the bottom 92%?"
"Trump promised he would stop big drug companies from ""getting away with murder."" He lied.. . My bill with @RepRoKhanna stops Big Pharma's greed by cutting prescription drug prices in half so that Americans no longer pay the highest prices in the world."
We will ensure that people in an aging society can receive the health care they need in their own homes instead of expensive and inadequate nursing homes and that the workers who provide that care aren’t forced to live on starvation wages.
"Jane and I wish you and your loved ones a very happy Independence Day.. . Together, we can and will create the kind of nation based on love and justice that we know we can become."
"Telling a worker making $52,000 a year that they're ""too rich"" to get the full $2,000 in direct relief is totally absurd.. . We made promises to the American people that we would help our working families—and those promises have got to be kept."
"In my view, we can no longer tolerate billionaires becoming obscenely rich at a time of unprecedented economic pain and suffering. The time has come to tax their wealth and break up tech giants and other huge conglomerates that have monopolized nearly every sector of our economy."
"For far too long, the United States has basically had a one-party foreign policy that favors militarism over diplomacy. Thanks to the hard work of many progressives, working on Yemen and other issues, that is finally changing."
"""We hate local, state, and federal governments, but we love Wall Street and big money!"". . The crisis we face today is the result of 40 years of those kinds of attacks on government. . . It is time for all of us to reject that kind of thinking."
For a company like Amazon which holds an unbelievable amount of wealth and power to treat its workers this way is simply unconscionable. This is the kind of corporate greed that is destroying the social fabric of our country.
"If you think the Freedom to Vote Act makes sense, you’re worried about American democracy, and you’re prepared to vote for the bill, then why are two Democrats wasting everybody's time and not voting for the rule change to see this through?. . That I do not understand."
"In the 21st century, a free public education system that goes from kindergarten through high school is no longer good enough. The time is long overdue to make public colleges and universities tuition-free and debt-free for working families."
"Two-thirds of the House voted to provide $2,000 in direct payments to the working class. Now it’s the Senate’s turn to do that—no excuses.. . Unless McConnell agrees to a vote on $2,000 relief checks, Congress will be spending New Year’s Eve in the Capitol."
"Maybe—just maybe—the most essential people in our economy are not hedge fund managers.. . Could it be that they are doctors, nurses, EMTs, grocery store workers, workers in drug stores, farm workers, and truck drivers?. . Let us begin to rethink some of our priorities."
"75 years ago, FDR talked about the need to guarantee every person in this country a good job as a fundamental right. That was true in 1944. It is true today."
I am introducing a resolution at 11:20 AM on the Senate floor to demand that the President of the United States represent the interests of the American people and not Russia. Watch here:
"Despite the Trump administration’s destructive efforts, we will not stop fighting for women’s rights and full reproductive justice."
Watch the town hall on Trump's decision to withdraw from the nuclear deal live here at 7 pm ET:
"Billionaire bankers just love socialism for the rich.. . Greedy hedge fund managers are now calling themselves ""small businesses"" to apply for government handouts. That is wrong.. . This aid is desperately needed to help Main Street, not Wall Street."
"Dealing with climate change now is not an ""option."" It's a necessity. If we do not lead the world in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel, there will not only be irreparable harm to our planet but a huge economic cost. Now is the time for a Green New Deal."
"Trump, the “great friend” of American workers, is now prepared to ignore the unanimous U.S. Senate bill to fund the government.. . While Trump heads off to his exclusive golf club in Florida, his Christmas gift to some 800,000 federal employees is to deny them their paychecks."
I applaud the Biden administration for taking this bold step to speed up the production and availability of coronavirus vaccines. I also recognize the dedicated work done by activists around the world to put this issue on the global agenda. We are all in this together.
"It would be unconscionable to leave Washington after giving tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations, while we ignore the enormous problems facing working families."
"At this week's Senate hearing, Trump administration officials repeatedly evaded my simple question. . . So I am once again asking: @SecAzar, when a COVID-19 vaccine is approved, will it be made available to everyone in America without cost?"
"The CIA concluded that the Saudi crown prince ordered the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. This sham trial, carried out by a despotic and lawless regime, looks more like a cover-up. . . Maybe Donald Trump might want to stop proclaiming his love and affection for the Saudi dictatorship."
"The Archbishop of Canterbury is right. It is unacceptable that companies like Amazon pay workers wages so low that they have to rely on government programs just to survive, while paying nothing in federal income taxes."
"After a lifetime of lying and cheating to enrich himself and his billionaire friends, Mr. Trump—shock of all shocks—has abandoned his campaign promise to have Medicare negotiate drug prices."
"Call me a radical, but I happen to believe that a job should lift workers out of poverty – not keep them in it."
"The Green New Deal for Public Housing addresses our climate and affordable housing crises together in a way that transforms our energy system, rebuilds public housing, and creates hundreds of thousands of good paying jobs in low-income and working-class communities."
"It is not too much to demand that in our democracy, everyone 18 years of age should be automatically registered to vote. End of discussion."
"The time is now to expand Medicare to cover hearing aids, eyeglasses, and dental visits."
"American troops have been in Afghanistan for nearly 18 years, Iraq since 2003 and in Syria since 2015.. . The American people do not want endless war. . . Congress must reassert its Constitutional authority over the use of force and responsibly end these interventions."
It is time to end the international disgrace of the United States being the only major country on Earth not to guarantee paid family and medical leave as a right.
"Today Gov. Scott Walker signed disgraceful, undemocratic legislation to limit the power of incoming Democratic officials in Wisconsin. Republicans like him across the country are attacking democracy and their power grabs must be stopped."
"Maybe I missed it, but I don't remember the need to provide tax breaks to wealthy hedge fund managers in the Virgin Islands being one of our nation's pressing crises. Yet that's exactly what Section 14504 of the GOP bill does."
"What the entire GOP proposal is about is giving tax breaks to people who don’t need it by making cuts to education, housing and health care."
The United States lags behind every major country on Earth when it comes to paid sick leave. It is time for Congress to follow the lead of states like mine and pass guaranteed sick leave for all Americans.
Corporate America doesn't want to reduce their tax rate down to 20 percent. They want it down to zero. And that's a burden that will fall on the backs of the middle class.
"Medicaid covers nearly half of all births in the U.S.. . But Donald Trump wants to cut Medicaid by $1.5 trillion.. . Our job: Stop Trump's cruel budget and guarantee health care to every woman, man and child in this country, not throw more people off the health care they have."
"Firenados in northern California. Ocean fires in the Gulf of Mexico. Subway waterfalls in New York City. A heat dome in the Northwest melting power cables, killing hundreds and frying marine animals. I have been told that combatting climate change is expensive. Compared to what?"
"As Senate Budget Committee Chairman, I want to give you an update on what's in the budget bill we're working on and why it is the most consequential legislation considered by Congress since the 1930s."
"The richest 400 billionaires pay lower taxes than fast-food workers. . . If we are to stop the war being waged by the billionaire class against working Americans, we need a tax on extreme wealth."
"Well, @SenTedCruz makes a great speech about farmers paying the estate tax. Unfortunately, it has nothing to do with reality."
No one in America should have to go to work sick just to make ends meet.. . Our coronavirus response must mean joining the rest of the industrialized world to guarantee paid sick leave for all.
"Wealth of Jeff Bezos in 2009: $6.8 billion. Wealth of Jeff Bezos in 2020: $184 billion. . Wealth of Mark Zuckerberg in 2009: $2 billion. Wealth of Mark Zuckerberg in 2020: $103 billion. . U.S. Minimum Wage from 2009-2020: $7.25. . We need an economy that works for all of us, not the 1%."
"Judge Kavanaugh believes net neutrality violates the First Amendment rights of corporations. Yes, corporations..."
"These are tough times for workers, boom times for corporations. While prices soar, 3 pharmaceutical companies increased their profits by 90% to $54 billion. Last quarter, 3 Big Oil companies made a record $46 billion in profits. We must stand together against corporate greed."
"Republicans talk about the cost of a Green New Deal. Really? If left unchecked, climate change, according to Deloitte, could cost the global economy $178 trillion over the next 50 years. Droughts, floods, extreme weather are expensive. Inaction is not a moral or economic option."
"Over 40 years, the richest 0.1% have seen their wages quadruple, leaving everyone—even the top 1%—behind.. . Here's how we reverse this trend:. ✅Ensure every job pays at least a living wage. ✅Rapidly expand unions. ✅Make the ultra-rich pay their taxes. ✅End corporate welfare"
"Further, it is likely that the Senate leadership will attach to the National Defense Authorization Act the so-called ‘competitiveness bill,’ which includes $52 billion in corporate welfare, with no strings attached, for a handful of extremely profitable microchip companies."
"On this Labor Day we thank the trade union movement for their ongoing struggle for justice. Yes. Every American is entitled to the right to join a union, decent wages and benefits, affordable housing, health care and educational opportunity. Let us go forward in solidarity."
"I proudly oppose Trump's NAFTA 2.0. The United States outsourced more than 170,000 jobs in the last three years. The deal doesn't even mention the words ""climate change."". . Our trade agreements must stop outsourcing and address the climate crisis threatening our planet."
43 million Americans face the threat of eviction.. . It's time to cancel rent and mortgage payments until this crisis is over.
"Why are Wall Street investors getting scared of fossil fuel stocks?.  . Because the climate justice movement is making it clear that political pressure for divestment will not stop. It will only grow stronger..  . To protect our planet, we are taking on Big Oil—and we're winning."
"Every two days last year, a multi-millionaire in the world became a billionaire. It's called a rigged global economy and this is how it works."
Republicans and the wealthiest Americans have worked to cut the IRS to benefit themselves. This is what a rigged economy and political system looks like.
"Mr. President. 800,000 federal employees and their families are human beings, not your play things. Do not treat them with contempt and disrupt their lives. They have kids. They have needs. Do not shut down the government again."
"The $600 in additional weekly unemployment income passed by Congress saved millions from financial ruin.. . Ending it could cost 5 million jobs and hurt countless struggling families. As coronavirus cases rise, we must extend this critical lifeline."
"Unfortunately, we have a corrupt political system and some Senators are more interested in getting campaign contributions from the wealthy and the powerful than doing the work of the American people. It’s a sad state of affairs."
"And let me also thank @SenSchumer for securing a vote on my amendment during the week of July 20th. If there was ever a time to fundamentally change our national priorities, now is that time. Let's cut the Pentagon budget and invest in healthcare and housing here at home."
"In this country we battle with words and ideas, not fists and bombs. .  . Acts of violence, appeals to violence and condoning violence have no place in American society."
@MittRomney Germany and other countries around the world make public colleges and universities in America tuition free. Let’s join that club.
The lies that occur here in Washington about health care systems around the world are really unbelievable.
"If @realDonaldTrump was serious about ending U.S. wars in the Middle East, he would’ve signed our bipartisan bill to stop the Yemen war instead of vetoing it.. . If Congress does not stand up to him and defund it, the Saudi-led war could kill 233,000 Yemenis by the end of the year."
"""I do not begrudge any pregnant person’s personal choice, whatever it is. That is, in fact, the whole point."". . I hope Americans who do not believe in abortion will consider this powerful op-ed by @RepJayapal. Abortion must remain a constitutional right."
"The pharmaceutical industry will claim the outrageous prices they charge for life-saving medicines are necessary. .  . Maybe they haven’t heard of a country that we share thousands of miles of a border with, where they sell the exact same drugs for a fraction of the price."
"The American people are hurting, and this comprehensive plan goes a long way to addressing the myriad crises that we face."
"Zero-emission electric buses manufactured in America, with good union wages, local hiring, and apprenticeships to bring marginalized communities into the green economy..  . Sound radical? It's already happening. This is what a Green New Deal is about."
The majority of the American people support the $3.5T reconciliation bill. 48 out of 50 Democrats in the Senate support the bill. 96% of Democrats in the House support the bill. . . No. Two people cannot sabotage what the overwhelming majority of this country want.
"At a time of unprecedented heatwaves, drought, flooding, extreme weather, and the acidification of the oceans, now is the time for us to make certain that the planet we leave future generations is healthy and habitable. That means finally standing up to the fossil fuel industry."
"Today, we remember the 3,000 Americans we lost on September 11, 2001, and we honor the bravery of the emergency workers who rushed into danger in order to save lives."
"While very light on substance, Trump and Kim Jong Un's meeting is a positive step in de-escalating tensions and addressing the threat of North Korea’s nuclear weapons. Congress has a key role to play in making sure this is a meaningful process, not just a series of photo ops."
"I have absolute confidence that if we have the courage and the determination to stand together and fight for justice, not only can we address the enormous crises that we face, but I believe we can move this country in a much stronger and better direction."
“It’s pathetic that we’re so wrapped up around AR-15s that we don’t want to protect children.” –retired Lt. Colonel Ralph Peters
I sat down with my friend @SarahKSilverman to explain what democratic socialism means to me. Watch the full interview here:
A vote for the Republican tax bill is a vote to cut Medicare by $400 billion over the next decade.
"Huge fires in Siberia with smoke spreading more than 3,000 miles. Major fires in Greece, California and Oregon. Heat wave in Italy. Increased drought throughout the planet.  We're in this together. The entire world must unite to combat climate change. There is no choice."
The American people do not want to spend billions of dollars on a wall which Trump told us would be paid for by Mexico. They want to protect Dreamers and working families.
"The attack by Israeli forces against mourners at the funeral of Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Akleh is an outrage. The United States must condemn this, and demand an independent investigation into her killing."
"Listen to how Amazon uses its own lingo to blur the distinction between billionaire CEO Jeff Bezos and the average Amazon employee making minimum wage, according to journalist @J_Bloodworth."
"Corporate greed is Amazon increasing its profits by 75% last year to a record $35 billion, denying workers a $3 raise, illegally underpaying drivers and blaming a $20 price hike in a Prime membership on ""inflation"" while Jeff Bezos became $81 billion richer during the pandemic."
"The extraordinary power of the corporate establishment is not just over our economy and political life, it is over our imagination and our ability to envision a different kind of world."
@BillCassidy Only problem is that by the time you get to page 145 protections for pre-existing conditions are gone.
"It’s time we make the richest 1% pay their damn taxes and make safe, affordable housing a human right."
There's a three-letter word stopping us from passing common sense gun safety legislation: NRA.
"Wendy's increased its net income by 70%, pays its CEO 532X more than its median worker & is spending $100 million on stock buybacks. Now it's blaming the rising price of a Frosty on inflation? No. The problem isn't the Wendy's worker who got a 50 cent raise. It's corporate greed."
The Koch brothers and their billionaire friends plan to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in the 2018 midterm elections. They may have the money. But we have the people. #BernieResponds
"No. We will not allow Trump's handpicked Postmaster General Louis DeJoy to slow down mail delivery, cut hours at post offices and sabotage the Postal Service. We will expand and strengthen it. It is way past time to fire Mr. DeJoy."
"This is historic. For the first time in 45 years, Congress is one step closer to withdrawing U.S. forces from an unauthorized war. We must end the war in Yemen."
"Today with this historic vote and every day we stand in solidarity with the Asian-American community all over this country. We reject the hate and racism that’s led to an increase in anti-Asian violence, particularly against women, older people, and workers."
"George Floyd's murder is the only latest in an endless series of police killings. . . Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Laquan McDonald, Tamir Rice, Alton Sterling, Breonna Taylor, Freddie Gray, Rekia Boyd, Walter Scott—and so many, many others.. . The U.S. Senate has got to act now."
"I believe, with @IlhanMN and my colleagues, that a complete investigation by @OSHA_DOL into Amazon warehouses is long overdue. The reports of dangerous, dehumanizing conditions—where 125,000 Americans are working for the wealthiest man in the history of the world—are sickening."
Veterans Affairs' single-payer program pays half as much as Medicare for the exact same drugs.. . There's absolutely no reason for this—other than greed.. . Congress must take on the pharmaceutical industry and make Medicare negotiate lower drug prices NOW.
"Yesterday, Republicans tried to ram through a bill that would have prevented rail workers from receiving sick leave and health care benefits. I was proud to block that effort on the floor of the Senate. If you missed it, tune in now."
"Joining us now: Catherine Coleman Flowers, founder of the Alabama Center for Rural Enterprise Community Development Corporation. #InequalityTownHall"
"Trump is right that it would be useful to take a serious look at the Postal Service. He's dead wrong, however, if he believes the solution is to privatize the Postal Service. The reality is that since 2014 the Postal Service has made an operating profit of more than $2.7 billion."
"If Trump refuses to sign the COVID-relief bill:. . -14 million will lose unemployment benefits. -The government will shutdown on Tuesday. -The eviction moratorium will end on New Year's Eve. . Mr. President: Sign this bill NOW & get the Republican Senate to pass $2,000 in direct relief"
Three people own more wealth than half of America.. . 13 million people are working two or three jobs to make ends meet.. . That is going to change when we make corporate America put workers on corporate boards and have a share in their companies' profits.
"At a time of massive income inequality, the billionaire class is opposing our agenda because they want to prevent Congress from making them finally pay their fair share of taxes. We must put an end to their greed."
Insulin in the United States should not cost 10 times what it costs in Canada.
Twenty-six of the wealthiest people on Earth own more than the bottom half of the world’s population. A handful of people at the top own more than 3.6 billion people. How grotesque is that?
"Apple's ""major"" announcement to invest $350 billion into the U.S. economy was a major PR move."
"How many people need to die, how many people need to get unnecessarily sicker before Congress is prepared to take on the greed of the prescription drug industry? . . Today, we are introducing legislation to end the pharmaceutical industry’s greed and drastically lower drug prices."
Crystal Mason is facing five years in jail—for the crime of voting. (with @ShaunKing)
"Unless we act boldly and quickly to take on the existential threat of climate change, we will see irreparable harm done to this planet."
"Michigan families face a new threat: flooding made worse by climate change and a failure to invest in infrastructure.. . This disaster reminds us we are all Americans. When any community is in trouble, all of our resources must be mobilized. Our thoughts are with everyone impacted."
"86 years ago, FDR signed Social Security into law. Since then, through good times and bad, Social Security has paid every benefit owed to every eligible American on time and without delay. Our job now is to expand, not cut, Social Security so that everyone can retire in dignity."
These Canadians want Americans to know: having health care as a right is real freedom.
"Corporate profits are at a 70-year high, median wages have gone down the sharpest in 25 years and corporations are spending $1 trillion on stock buybacks. Our goal must not be to ""get wages down."" Our goal must be to end corporate greed. The Fed must stop raising interest rates."
"ICYMI: Watch the CEOs vs. Workers town hall, aired last night, on the enormous disparity between the wealth of corporate executives and the wages and treatment of workers at companies like Amazon, McDonald's, Disney, Walmart and American Airlines."
When I was in high school and college I ran the mile and cross-country and loved track and field. So it has been a lot of fun for me personally to watch Elle's incredible achievements and to cheer her on. Like many other Vermonters I look forward to seeing what Elle does next.
"At a time when tens of millions of people are working for starvation wages, Republicans think they can starve people back to work. That is unacceptable."
Taxpayer dollars should not go to multibillion dollar companies that violate labor laws. Period.
Spring weather in Antarctica is truly insane.. . Climate change is an existential threat to humanity. We must mobilize America and the rest of the world accordingly.
"Trump wants to privatize the Postal Service over a personal grudge, using faulty data. Congress has got to stop him.. . We must fully fund the Postal Service so it can continue to deliver medication, mail-in ballots, and other necessities to all Americans."
"The time is long, long past for us to put the lives of children and innocent Americans over the interests of the NRA’s corporate backers."
Cancel student debt now. All of it.
"Astoundingly, we have climate change policies being written by the world's biggest polluters. As @KateAronoff says, it is not enough to ask whether or not people believe in global warming, but what they can do to save this planet for future generations."
"Millions of Americans are working for 11 or 12 bucks an hour..  . They can't afford childcare.. They can't afford health care.. They're scared to death about their retirement..  . They want a government that represents them, not just billionaires and large corporations."
"I stand with the @AFTunion in demanding fundamental changes to our national priorities. We don't need tax breaks for billionaires. We need to invest in high-quality public education, universal child care and making public colleges and universities tuition-free."
The Trump administration's slavish devotion to corporate profits and their contempt for the health and well-being of Americans and people throughout the world is beyond appalling.
"Today we mark the 100th birthday of Nelson Mandela, who led the struggle to end the horrible apartheid system in South Africa. Let his courage and commitment to equality and justice serve as an example to all of us as we work to create a better world."
"Air traffic controllers got paychecks for a total of $0 today because of Trump's government shutdown.. . This is a crisis!. . Mr. Trump, stop holding our federal employees hostage as political pawns. Open the government now."
I'm excited to announce that @Ocasio2018 will join our Climate Change Town Hall on Monday at 7 PM ET to discuss her Green New Deal proposal. . . RSVP here:
I think there is a growing understanding that there is something fundamentally wrong when three people in America own more wealth than the bottom half of the country.
"The U.S. and our allies must impose severe sanctions on Vladimir Putin and his fellow oligarchs. At a time when thousands may die as a result of his war, Putin, one of the richest people in the world, should not be allowed to enjoy the billions he stole from the Russian people."
It is an honor to be with one of our great progressive leaders @NYCMayor fighting for a millionaires tax to fix our infrastructure.
"Today, our illustrious president said that Medicare for all ""can't be afforded."" Mr. President, it's your disastrous efforts to take health care away from millions of Americans that can't be afforded."
"All of a sudden, Mitch McConnell is ""worried"" about giving a $2,000 check to someone who ""doesn't need it."". . That's funny. He had no problem giving a $560 million tax break to Sheldon Adelson who is worth $34.3 billion. Total hypocrisy! Let the Senate vote on $2,000 now, Mitch!"
"If President Trump is really concerned about national security then why isn't he paying employees at the FBI, TSA and other security agencies who work every day to protect this country? . . President Trump. End your shutdown of the government. Pay federal employees."
It is time to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. The working class is demanding it.
"Major League Baseball’s announcement to eliminate the Vermont Lake Monsters and 39 other Minor League teams has everything to do with greed.. . If Major League Baseball does not reconsider this proposal, I think it’s time for Congress to rescind the huge tax breaks it has received."
President Trump's associates who have pleaded guilty to or been convicted of serious crimes – so far:. . - His campaign chairman. - His deputy campaign chairman. - His lawyer. - His national security advisor. - His foreign policy advisors
"The business model of Wall Street is fraud. When the 6 largest American banks have $10 trillion in assets, equivalent to 54% of our GDP, it's time to break them up. We need banks which invest in the real economy and create jobs, not rip us off."
"Trump's incompetence has been deadly. Six months after the first U.S. coronavirus case was reported, health workers are still reusing masks, gowns and gloves in the wealthiest country on Earth.. . Congress must act NOW to produce the protective gear we need."
"I’ll be LIVE on the floor of the Senate at 1:30pm ET to discuss why, at a time of massive wealth and income inequality, now is not the time for Congress to hand a $53 billion blank check to the microchip industry."
Evictions must be banned for the entirety of this crisis. This is a matter of racial and economic justice that Congress cannot ignore.
"On this day 77 years ago, Allied forces liberated the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. Today, on Holocaust Remembrance Day, we must recommit to fighting all forms of bigotry, intolerance, antisemitism, racism, and xenophobia."
"This is yet another move by Trump that will be welcomed by authoritarians around the world. The United States should be leading the way in upholding international human rights standards, not targeting ICC personnel and their families with sanctions."
"The pandemic has been an economic nightmare for the working class. Millions have lost their jobs and their health care—now they may lose their homes. Not acceptable. We need government of the people, by the people, for the people. Congress must act boldly."
"Donald Trump spoke for over an hour last night on many issues, yet somehow he forgot to mention the words ""climate change."" He continues to believe that climate change is a “hoax.” What an outrage. #FossilFree"
"If every major country on the planet can guarantee health care to all and achieve better health outcomes, while spending less per capita, please do not tell us that the United States of America cannot do the same."

"The internment of Japanese Americans is a stain on our history. It abhorrent that 75 years later, this administration now wants to hold migrant children in one of those same camps. . . We will look back on Trump’s racist child prisons as an abomination."
Today we passed an historic war powers resolution to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Watch our press conference live now.
"Dr. King's vision of ending the triple evils of racism, economic injustice and war is as important today as it was when Dr. King fought for those principles, and must motivate us in all of our work. #MLKDay"
"America's billionaires got $1 TRILLION richer in 2021. Meanwhile, millions of Americans are struggling to put food on the table..  . Does that sound to anyone like an economy that works?"
"I worry very much what the coronavirus will do, particularly in Yemen, where the U.S.-backed Saudi war has put millions on the brink of starvation.. . Let us use the five-year anniversary of this horrific conflict to end our military involvement. Yemen needs peace, not U.S. bombs."
"When Mr. Trump blames immigrants for crime, he spreading a racist lie.. . Instead of frightening 11 million undocumented people with deportation, we need comprehensive immigration reform and a path to citizenship."
"Trump's reckless shutdown is threatening the livelihoods of some 800,000 federal workers. Mr. President: Enough is enough. Federal workers must be paid and the government must reopen."
"Wealth of Elon Musk on March 18, 2020: $24.5 billion. Wealth of Elon Musk on January 9, 2021: $209 billion. . U.S. minimum wage in 2009: $7.25 an hour. U.S. minimum wage in 2021: $7.25 an hour. . Our job: Raise the minimum wage to at least $15, tax the rich & create an economy for all."
My thoughts are with the people of Puerto Rico recovering from Hurricane Maria's devastation. We must do everything we can to help rebuild.
John Bolton claims Trump told him he would withhold military aid from Ukraine until the country helped him investigate Democrats.. . The Senate must hear from Bolton as a witness in the impeachment proceedings.
We must not allow our younger generation to have a lower standard of living than their parents. One way to create good paying jobs is to grow the trade union movement and fight for decent wages and benefits.
The United States Congress must do everything it can to prevent the Trump Administration’s attempts to put us on the brink of a catastrophic and unconstitutional war with Iran.
"Let’s be clear: Donald Trump is either a tax cheat who pays less in income taxes than the average worker, or a bad businessman who has lost money year after year—likely both."
"I'm honored that Luis Alcauter will be my guest at the #StateOfTheUnion. Luis is not a statistic, and he is certainly not a bargaining chip. He is a human being who deserves our support. We cannot abandon Luis and all the other Dreamers."
"For the first time, the U.S. Senate just voted to advance a resolution withdrawing U.S. Armed Forces from an unauthorized and unconstitutional war. . . Let us bring this catastrophic war in Yemen to an end, and help bring peace and humanitarian aid to this tortured country."
"I am going to the Senate floor to vote AGAINST Trump’s huge arms sale to the United Arab Emirates.. . The United States should be working to deescalate conflict in the Middle East, not fueling it by selling more and more weapons to regimes using them to kill civilians."
For far too many people it's too difficult to get to the polls. We need to make it much easier for everyone to participate in the democratic process. Election Day should be a national holiday.
Who is suffering the most because of preconditions which laid them open to coronavirus—because they have not had the decent health care they’ve needed? Disproportionately Black and brown people. . . This systemic racism must be addressed and ended.
"More than 13 million American children live in poverty.. . Our childhood poverty rate is among the highest of any major country on Earth.. . In my view, we should feed the children first, educate the children first, and worry about the military-industrial complex later."
"The American people are subsidizing Amazon workers’ food stamps while their boss, Jeff Bezos, is the richest man in the world. It’s time to get Mr. Bezos off of welfare."
"Half a million people are sleeping on the streets.. . 15 million children live in poverty.. . ⅓ of Americans lack adequate health care.. . In my view, being a human being means you are entitled to a roof over your head, to a doctor and medicine, and to a dignified standard of living."
"Trump has told the American people several hundred times that Mexico would pay for the wall. That is a lie. If his wall were to be built, Mexico would not pay for it. American taxpayers would."
"Abortion is a constitutional right, period. If men were the ones giving birth, I doubt that this would be in question. We must stand up and defend a woman’s right to control her own body. We must pass legislation that codifies Roe v. Wade as the law of the land."
"The Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy of separating children, including infants as young as one year old, from their parents at the border is inhumane, cruel and an affront to our values as Americans."
".@RevDrBarber, AFL-CIO President @RichardTrumka, and SEIU President @MaryKayHenry are exactly right. We must end starvation wages and give 32 million Americans a raise by increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour."

"Pharma companies lied about the addictive impacts of opioids, yet not one of them has been held fully accountable for this crisis.. . We have got to start punishing their greed and recklessness which is killing tens of thousands of Americans every year."
"Congress must pass legislation that codifies Roe v. Wade as the law of the land in this country NOW. And if there aren’t 60 votes in the Senate to do it, and there are not, we must end the filibuster to pass it with 50 votes."
"TONIGHT: I had a very good discussion last week with White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator @AshishKJha46 about where we are with the pandemic and where we go from here. If you missed it, we are rebroadcasting it tonight at 7pm ET!"
We can no longer tolerate an economy and a political system that have been rigged to benefit the wealthiest Americans in this country at the expense of everyone else.
Congress must act in an unbelievably aggressive way to tell all workers: You will be made whole. You will get 100% of your paycheck.
How obscene is a law enforcement system that arrests the survivor of a workplace disaster rather than those who exploit their workers and put them in dangerous conditions?.  . The targeting and demonizing of undocumented people must end immediately.
"More than 65% of the people in county or city jails on any given day in 2016 had not been convicted of a crime, often because they lack the money to pay bail. . . In other words, we have criminalized poverty."
"What would it mean for you to get a bank account, a small loan, a debit card or check cashing—all at your local post office?. . At 2:30PM ET, @SenGillibrand and I will discuss our Postal Banking Act to provide all Americans with basic banking services. Ask us your questions below."
"Enough is enough! Tonight at 5:30pm ET, I will go to the floor with @SenAmyKlobuchar to DEMAND that the U.S. Senate finally pass legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs. We must stand up to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry."
Fox News is afraid that the American people will find out the truth about Canada's single-payer health care.
"I agree with @SenatorShaheen. We need a Senate investigation to understand how this decades-long pattern of sexual assault against young gymnasts could have gone on and on. We should be supportive of our young athletes in this country, not allow them to be horribly exploited."
"Our public health experts are telling us universal mask wearing can bring this pandemic under control within weeks.. . This is not political or partisan issue. We must provide all of our people with high-quality, reusable masks—free of charge—and save lives."
"Today’s vote is about much more than a wall or whether there is a national emergency on the southern border. There is not.. . It's about whether we are a nation of laws, where the president obeys the Constitution and democratic processes. We will not become an authoritarian nation."
"🚨 14.7 million Americans are still out of work. Coronavirus infections are rising at an unprecedented rate. 🚨. . Until this crisis is over, we must:. . 💵Provide $2,000 a month per person. 🏥Ensure medical care without cost. 👷‍♀️Guarantee workers' wages. 💳Extend unemployment benefits"
"The American people are reaching out to us. They are saying, ""we are hurting."" When people are hurting in a democratic society, government is supposed to respond to their pain. If we can't stand up for the working families that we represent, we don't deserve to be here."
We will substantially reduce our childhood poverty rate by expanding the Child Tax Credit so that families continue to receive monthly direct payments of up to $300 per child.
"If the White House Gift Shop is going to produce $100 COVID-19 coins, Trump can sure as hell utilize the Defense Production Act to manufacture the gloves, gowns, and masks our medical workers desperately need."
It also means that Congress will continue to ignore the existential threat to our country and planet with regard to climate change.
"""Make no mistake, the Trump shutdown is anti-veteran,"" - This Iraq War Marine Corps veteran @will_c_fischer wants you to know that 31 percent of all federal employees are veterans and Trump is holding many of their paychecks hostage. (With @votevets)"
.@SenatorDurbin asked Judge Kavanaugh if he would support an FBI investigation to clear his name. He refused to answer.
"Let's be clear. The problem is not the worker who got a small raise & a $1,400 check 7 months ago. The problem is corporations making record-breaking profits while 700 billionaires became $2 trillion richer during the pandemic. We need an economy that works for all, not the 1%."
"@Ilhan @RepJayapal @rweingarten @AFTunion Here's our plan to make all public colleges, trade schools and universities tuition free, and eliminate all student debt while making Wall Street speculators pay for every penny of it:"
The federal minimum wage for tipped workers is a starvation wage of $2.13 an hour. . . We must raise it to at least $15 an hour and make it easier for workers to join unions.
"Instead of listening to the billionaire class, now is the time for the Senate to listen to the needs of working families, the elderly, the sick, the disabled, and the poor..  . Let us pass this Budget Resolution to provide the relief Americans need."
"We will not let Trump destroy the Post Office to sabotage this election. This is a democracy, not a dictatorship."
"Because the president revoked DACA, some 800,000 young people are living in extraordinary anxiety about whether or not they're going to lose legal status and be subject to deportation. We have got to deal with that decision."
"This is what oligarchy looks like: large corporations get trillions in tax cuts and subsidies, while nannies, home care workers and housekeepers are denied basic labor protections against underpayment and harassment.. . Congress must pass a #DomesticWorkerBillofRights."
"It’s important that we reject abstinence-only education and support what the American people want: sex education in our schools that provides young people with accurate, comprehensive information about sex that will make them safer."
"The Big Oil side deal requires the president to prioritize 25 energy projects for expedited environmental reviews. Of those, 19 could be dirty fossil fuel or mining projects and ZERO are required to be renewable energy projects that would reduce emissions. That is unacceptable."
"It will guarantee that no family pays over 7 percent of their income for child care. It will, finally, provide paid family and medical leave for working people."
"I will be listening eagerly for any Republican to tell me they will not come back from increasing the deficit $1.4 trillion with cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security."
We will end the international disgrace of the United States being the only major country on earth not to guarantee paid family and medical leave as a right.
"Oligarchy and massive wealth inequality exists not just in Russia. It's worldwide. Since the pandemic, while the wealth of the world's 10 richest people DOUBLED, the income of 99% of the world’s population declined. The result: More yachts for the rich. More hunger for the poor."
"Since 1968, there have been more than 1.5 million gun-related deaths on US territory. . . Since the founding of the United States, there have been about 1.4 million Americans killed in wars."
Republicans have set the stage to pass tax cuts for the top 1%. We must mobilize to demand their plan is defeated.
I'm on the Senate floor NOW talking about why it's time to eliminate the tipped minimum wage of $2.13 an hour.
Fossil fuel profits are not more important than our planet.
Anybody who believes we can create the meaningful change this country needs without standing up to the greed and corruption of the ruling class is sorely mistaken.
"I want the people in Puerto Rico, as well as those in the Virgin Islands, to know that they are not alone, they have not been forgotten."
"We’ve been told that some were even forced to sleep in their cars and hotels to protect their families. These employees are heroes and heroines and should be treated as such. Sadly, you have taken another approach."
"The United States once led the world in the percentage of young college graduates. Today, we are in 11th place, one in every four Americans has student debt, and 40 percent of all borrowers are expected to default by 2023. #CancelStudentDebt"
"This is what oligarchy looks like. During the pandemic, 630 billionaires have seen their wealth go up by $565 billion while almost everyone else has seen their wealth go down by $6.5 trillion. We cannot push this grotesque inequality under the rug."
"While the owners of Walmart, the wealthiest family in the country, became over $60 billion richer during the pandemic, they are now slashing the paid leave of their employees in half. Outrageous. We must end corporate greed and raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour."
What does the $600 a week in additional unemployment insurance mean for you and your family?
One year ago 58 people were killed and 800 injured by a gunman in Las Vegas. My thoughts are with those victims' families today. We have got to prevent more innocent Americans from becoming victims of gun violence by passing commonsense gun safety legislation.
Listen to the American people. They are hurting. They cannot pay their rent or put food on the table. .  . President Trump and Senator McConnell: Enough. No more golfing. No more vacations. Pass the relief our people need NOW.
"I’m no historian, but I think it’s fair to say that there’s probably never been a president less qualified than Trump."
"Donald Trump has lied more than 3,000 times since taking office but Republicans refuse to say Trump is a liar. What's going on?"
"My dad came from what I guess Trump would call a ""shithole"" country. He was able to come to the U.S. and became a very proud American."
"Remember some of the same people who tell us we can’t afford to make community college free or provide paid family leave, all support massive tax breaks for the wealthy and big corporations."
Puerto Ricans are suffering. They are American citizens entitled to the same help as everyone else. We've got to do all we can to help.
"Trump promised a nation of ""law and order"" and to be ""tough on crime."" So why is he letting corporate criminals off the hook?"
"We must have the guts to stand up to special interests, and fight for the working class of this country."
Watch @RepRoKhanna tell Fox News why Medicare for all is the way forward when it comes to health care:
"As a result of the American Rescue Plan passed several months ago by Congress and signed into law by President Biden, bold action will be taken to cut childhood poverty in half and make it easier for moms, dads, and caregivers to raise their children."
"If we do not have the courage to stand up to the wealthy and powerful, future generations will look back at this Congress and say, “Where were you?”"
"In the richest country in the history of the world, keeping teeth in your mouth as you grow old should not be a luxury. We must expand Medicare NOW."
"Join me and Rev. William Barber II live from Duke University for a conversation on the enduring challenge of a moral economy, 50 years after Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. challenged racism, poverty, and militarism."
"I stand proudly with labor unions, environmental organizations and family farmers against Trump’s NAFTA 2.0.. . In my view, we must rewrite our disastrous trade agreements to end the outsourcing of American jobs, combat climate change, and stop the destructive race to the bottom."
"While Trump and the GOP cut taxes for the top 1%, they want to return us to a time when workers could not engage in collective bargaining..  . Unions are the backbone of America's middle class. Graduate student workers must have the right to join a union and earn a living wage."
"Absurdly, in the middle of a pandemic, Trump is fighting in the courts to end:. . 👨🏽‍⚕️Guaranteed coverage for preexisting conditions. 🏥Emergency care. 💉Free federally recommended vaccines. . Today is the ten-year anniversary of the ACA, and I will be damned if we let Trump repeal it."
Wall Street cannot continue functioning as a gambling casino. It's time for a tax on Wall Street speculation so that we can raise the funds to cancel student debt and make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
"It is imperative that Senators be allowed to vote on whether we should give Jeff Bezos a $10 billion handout to go to the moon and give, with no strings attached, $53 billion to massively profitable microchip companies. I'm going to do all I can to make sure those votes happen."
The United States must call for an immediate cease-fire and an end to provocative and illegal settlement activity. And we must also recommit to working with Israelis and Palestinians to finally end this conflict.
Cynthia Murray has worked at Walmart for 18 years and still doesn’t make $15 an hour. That is a disgrace.
"Yes, the economy is great—for the top 1 percent, who now earn 46 percent of all new income. Not for the nearly 80 percent of Americans living paycheck to paycheck."
Here's how Trump's world of fiction is undermining our democracy and how we can fight back:
"For the millions of DREAMers and TPS holders whose lives have been thrown into chaos by Mr. Trump’s bigotry, we have got to pass this legislation now. I call on Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to bring this bill to the floor for a vote immediately."
"Does Donald Trump want a war with Iran? Who knows? Nobody in the world knows what they'll do tomorrow. And given the confusion in this administration, it’s possible they may. . . But this I do know: The United States Congress must do everything it can to prevent this war."
The last thing we should do right now is provide 100s of billions in tax breaks to the wealthiest people and most profitable corporations.
Crystal Mason is going to prison for voting. The voter suppression in this country is out of control.
"We have a president who really does not believe in democracy.. . What Trump is saying is: I don't care what mayors say, I don't care what governors say, I am the president, I will send federal agents to Portland or any place in this country.. . That is what a police state is about."
"Do you know why 1 out of 4 Americans can't afford their prescription drugs?. . Do you know why thousands of Americans die every year because they can’t afford their medicine?. . Do you know why millions of Americans ration their insulin?. . I'll tell you why: greed, greed, greed."
Drug prices in 🇺🇸 vs. 🇨🇦. . Entocourt for Crohn's Disease:. 🇺🇸 $830. 🇨🇦 $80. . Flovent Diskus for Asthma:. 🇺🇸 $242. 🇨🇦 $28. . Crestor for Cholesterol:. 🇺🇸 $332 . 🇨🇦 $67. . Januvia for Diabetes:. 🇺🇸 $585. 🇨🇦 $126. . 2 EpiPens:. 🇺🇸 $686. 🇨🇦 $278. . We must end this greed & collusion & lower drug prices
"This government shutdown is part of the long-term, anti-government ideology paid for by the Koch brothers."
"Here's the business model: . . • Flood the country with painkillers. • Lie about the addictive effects. • Start opioid epidemic . • Cut a deal, admit no wrongdoing. • Hide money in Swiss bank accounts. . The billionaire Sackler family must be held criminally liable for their greed."
The Constitution is very clear that it is Congress and not the president who has war-making powers. Congress has abdicated that responsibility for a very long time. #BernieTownHall
Sen. Franken has said that he will be making an announcement about his political future tomorrow. The right thing is for him to resign.
There is something profoundly wrong in America when a company like Exelan can raise the price of a generic drug to treat high blood pressure (lisinopril) by 536% to as much as $550. How many more Americans have to die and suffer before Congress has the guts to end this greed?
"Cherry Garcia. Phish Food. Chunky Monkey. Super Fudge Chunk. Ben & Jerry not only revolutionized the world of ice cream, but they also showed the world what a progressive and community-minded business could look like."
"We must not be about tearing small children away from their families. In 2002, I voted against creation of DHS and the establishment of ICE. That was the right vote. . . What our cruel and broken immigration system needs is comprehensive reform."
"Too many seniors are living in desperate poverty, unable to afford their medicine or basic needs. Many Republicans want to cut Social Security benefits. That's wrong. We need to expand them. Tomorrow, I will be outlining my plan to do that."
"Today, we mourn the loss of Luis Alvarez, a champion for the health of 9/11 first responders, and one of the selfless men and women who searched for survivors at Ground Zero. . . We must build a society where we take care of each other and treat heath care as a human right."
"And after providing a massive tax break for the wealthy that will blow a $1.5 trillion hole in the deficit, Trump complains about the domestic spending initiatives secured by the Democratic Caucus to address the needs of working families and the middle class."
"The American people are not falling for billionaires' anti-worker propaganda. Support for unions is near a 50-year high. . . More unions will rebuild the middle class, combat corporate greed, and ensure that workers get their fair share. The labor movement makes our country strong."
"Our $15 minimum wage bill would give a raise to over 40 million Americans, including more than half of African American and Latinx workers. A job should lift you out of poverty, not keep you in it. It's time every worker in America is paid a living wage."
"Today, the House rightly recognized that D.C.'s 700,000 residents deserve full citizenship as Americans.. . If Senate Republicans are sincere in their belief that there can be no taxation without representation, they must immediately schedule a vote to grant statehood to D.C."
You better believe McDonald's can afford to pay all of its workers at least $15 an hour. I'm live NOW with workers who are striking today for dignity on the job.
"We will not allow Republicans to divide us up between those working class Americans who went to college and left deeply in debt against those who did not. All of us need to stand together for an economy that works for all, not just the 1%."
"If Republicans will not come back from passing a $1.4 trillion deficit increase with cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and other programs—come down to the floor of the United States Senate and tell me that I’m wrong."
"The world spends a total of $1.7 trillion a year on the military.. . The cost to end poverty is $175 billion per year for 20 years, about 10% of what the world spends on weapons.. . Donald Trump thinks we should spend more on these weapons. I want to spend less. #SandersSAIS"
"I can't believe we have to say this in the year 2018: Poverty is not a crime.. . Hundreds of thousands of Americans, convicted of nothing, should not be in jail because they can't afford their bail."
"I'm proud that the Vermont Senate voted to raise the state minimum wage to $15/hour, which will give a much–needed raise to more than 65,000 Vermonters. I will continue to fight for a $15 federal minimum wage, because no worker in America should earn starvation wages."
"This is an unprecedented moment in American history. The Democrats in Congress must move forward boldly, protecting the working families of our country and restoring faith in government. Yes, the future of the country is at stake."
STARTING SOON: Join me and @NYCMayor on Facebook Live at 12:30 ET. Watch at
"What recent union victories show is that working class Americans are sick and tired of being exploited by large corporations. This Labor Day, let us stand together in the fight for justice."
The Democratic Party cannot continue to ignore the needs of the working class of our country and expect to retain majority control in the US House and US Senate. It’s time to show which side we’re on. It’s time to start voting.
"This is something I passionately believe in: health care must be a human right for every man, woman and child in America."
"Health care is a right, not a privilege. We need Medicare for All so we can end the disgrace of 30 million Americans having no health insurance, and many more being underinsured with high deductibles and co-payments."
I am introducing a bill with Rep. Khanna to stop Donald Trump from illegally taking us to war against Iran.. . It's working-class kids who will have to fight and die in a disastrous new Middle East conflict—not the children of billionaires.
"What I want to know is: if Sears has $25 million to give bonuses to executives, why is the company telling laid off employees they don't have the money to pay their severance?"
The fact that Congressional Republicans and the White House would release a memo the FBI itself says is misleading is a sad example of a political party putting partisanship above patriotism.
LIVE: @SenWarren joins the Senate Budget Committee to testify on the incredible concentration of ownership on Wall Street and what that means for working people.
"In my humble opinion, a great nation is not judged by the number of billionaires or nuclear weapons it has.. . It is judged by how it treats the weakest and most vulnerable people amongst us."
"Trump's NAFTA 2.0 is filled with giveaways for Big Pharma and major corporations. We need trade agreements that build an inclusive economy for all, not just the 1%."
"Today, we are beginning to restore faith in our government amongst our people. They are hurting, and we are responding."
"At a time when half of older Americans have no retirement savings and are worried about their ability to retire with dignity and millions of seniors are living in poverty, our job is not to cut Social Security. Our job must be to expand Social Security."
We are spending $80 billion locking people up. Think about what it would mean if we invested that money in our people instead of more jails.
"Our planet just experienced the hottest January in recorded history..  . If our political system won't allow us move quickly to 100% renewable energy as the scientists say we must, I believe it is time for a political revolution."
Do you think it’s a coincidence that the racist manifesto of the El Paso shooter echoes Trump’s language of “invasion” and “infestation” of immigrants? I don’t. . . @realDonaldTrump is fanning the flames of white supremacy. We must stop him.
Alec Smith died at 26 because he was rationing insulin that was too expensive. . . Now Big Pharma is suing to block a law passed in his honor to make insulin more affordable.. . Let’s be clear about this: Big Pharma’s greed is literally killing people in this country.
"⚠️The past 5 years are the hottest on record. ⚠️This June is the hottest June recorded. ⚠️Thousands die in heatwaves around the world. . Trump's ignorance is threatening the lives of our children. For their sake, we must stand up to the fossil fuel industry and build a green economy."
40% of fast-food workers have reported experiencing sexual harassment. That is simply unacceptable.. . We must stand with the brave McDonald’s workers protesting today to demand the company address this epidemic of sexual harassment.
Listen to this Florida public school teacher: arming teachers is not the answer to our mass shooting crisis.
"My friend @RepRoKhanna is right: it is Orwellian for Congress to hand over billions of dollars worth of weapons and bombs to a president waging a horrific, unconstitutional war in Yemen—and call that progressive."
You know what's really scary? Millionaires and billionaires using their wealth and power to undermine our democracy.
"Despite what President Trump says, it is not “a hot economy” when 43% of households can't afford to pay for housing, food, child care, health care, transportation and a cell phone without going into debt. That is not a hot economy. #SOTU"
TOWN HALL TONIGHT: Do you have a question you want to ask the panel at tonight's town hall on Trump's decision to leave the Iran nuclear deal? Leave a response below.
It is too late for us to carry on with establishment politics and establishment economics. This is not my opinion—it is just a scientific reality.
"For the first time in history, a one-party government was unable to keep the government going. That is pathetic."
".@AGWilliamTong and 43 other attorneys general have damning proof that major drug companies have been colluding on price, stealing billions from American patients and taxpayers.. . I look forward to working with him to ensure they are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."
Never-ending wars must end. Join me and @RandPaul for a hearing to investigate the impact and the constitutional implications of open-ended war.
"There will be no real social progress in this country unless we have the courage to take on Wall Street, the insurance companies, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry, and all other forces of greed."
"Under the so-called ""War on Drugs,"" men on street corners dealing pot were thrown in jail. I want to see a war on the corporate greed that is killing Americans. I want to see top executives held personally liable for actions that led to the deaths of more than 42,000 people."
"Two months after Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are still living in misery. As a nation we must do better."
We have a crisis in primary health care. @WhipClyburn and I are introducing legislation to fix it and provide health care to millions of Americans.
"I am glad to be home in Burlington to rest for a little bit. I want to thank all of you for your well wishes, love, and support over the week. I am recovering well and feeling much better. . . I am more determined than ever to fight alongside you to make health care a human right."
Join me today at 4:45 ET for a Facebook live conversation with journalists from four leading social media news outlets about the state of politics and digital media.
"Thank you @SenatorDurbin @SenWarren @CoryBooker for co-sponsoring our War Powers Resolution on Yemen, and joining our effort to reassert Congressional authority in matters of war."
"President Trump proposed cutting Social Security benefits by $25 billion in his budget. That should outrage all of us, young and old alike. . . No, Mr. President, we will not let you cut Social Security. We will fight to expand it."
Nearly 18 million households are paying over 50% of their incomes on housing. That is absurd..  . It’s time for bold action. It’s time for an unprecedented investment in affordable housing.
Congratulations to UVM Medical Center residents on their overwhelming vote to unionize! New doctors should not be forced to work 80 hours a week for incredibly low wages. I’m proud to stand in solidarity with you.
AR-15s have one purpose: to kill and maim human beings.. . Ban assault weapons.
Nobody thinks the issue of gun safety is going to be an easy issue to solve. But in some ways I think the shooting in Florida is going to be the straw that broke the camel’s back.
"Trains from Boston to D.C. take 7-8 hours. Trains from Beijing to Shanghai go nearly twice as far in half the time..  . A Green New Deal means major public investments in American-made high-speed rail. We can lower emissions, create good union jobs, and improve our quality of life."
Thousands of medical workers are getting laid off and falling sick when we need them most.. . Can a rational person argue our current “system” makes any sense?. . @RepJayapal and I believe it’s time to learn from this crisis and make health care a human right:
"“We now have the resources, we now have the skills, we now have the techniques to get rid of poverty. And the question is whether our nation has the will.” — Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr."
"More importantly, it will end all leverage that we have to pass a major reconciliation bill. That means there will be no serious effort to address the long-neglected crises facing the working families of our country, the children, the elderly, the sick and the poor."
Americans living with HIV/AIDS should not have to suffer because they can’t afford the outrageous prices charged for medicine they need to live.. . Our job is to bring down the cost of prescription drugs and make health care a right for all. #WorldAIDSDay
Thank you to the young people standing up to fossil fuel corporations and leading the movement to combat climate change. #ThisIsZeroHour
"One year ago today, Donald Trump vetoed our bipartisan legislation to end U.S. involvement in Saudi Arabia's brutal war in Yemen.. . Now, as a pandemic threatens millions of Yemenis, the U.S. must finally say: Stop the bombings. Lift the blockade. Let food and medicine into Yemen."
"34 million Americans do not have health insurance, and thousands die each year because they cannot afford medical care. Today we reintroduced #MedicareForAll so that every American can get the health care they need."
"Last year Amazon's federal income tax rate was zero. That was apparently too much for my Republican colleagues. Under the Trump tax bill, Amazon will get an additional $789 million tax break on the profits they shifted to offshore tax havens."
Someone alert the authorities: Senate Republicans are looting the Treasury. I’m live now speaking about the Republican tax bill:
Marijuana must be legalized. All our people imprisoned because of it must be returned home to their families and their records expunged.
Have you lived abroad and seen firsthand what universal health care looks like? Apply to be a panelist at the Medicare for All Town Hall in Washington on Jan. 23.
"To the @SenateMajldr: The House did its job. Now, I call on you to bring the #EqualityAct to the Senate floor so that we finally protect LGBTQ people across America from discrimination in housing, employment and other critical parts of their lives. . . Do your job."
"This is outrageous. The Saudi-led war on Yemen is killing thousands of people, including a school bus full of children last month. America's role should not simply be to help our Saudi clients manage the slaughter more responsibly; we need to stop supporting it altogether."
Privatizing the VA would be an insult to the more than 22 million veterans who risked their lives to defend our country.
"All over this country, the American people are asking a simple question: How many people need to die, how many people need to get unnecessarily sicker before Congress is prepared to take on the greed of the prescription drug industry?"
"We are not going to waste another 40 years testing trickle-down economics, which have devastated America's working class.. . The time is long overdue for the rich to start paying their damn taxes."
"This pandemic is devastating the Navajo Nation, which already struggled with poverty, lack of running water and inadequate medical care.. . Indigenous communities like the Navajo Nation cannot be neglected any longer. Congress must provide full federal support to make them whole."
We must stop a government shutdown.
"""How do you pay for it?"" This is how. . . Watch live as @RepBarbaraLee and I introduce legislation to tax Wall Street greed."
"It is not acceptable for corporate America to make huge profits ripping off working families at the gas station, at the grocery store, or at any other sector of our economy. We have got to put an end to corporate greed."
".@JimCarrey is right. If Canada can provide health care to everyone, the U.S. can too. #MedicareForAll"
LIVE: Some of my colleagues in the Senate want to give in to the extortion of the microchip industry and hand them a $76 billion blank check. I say instead let’s enact the agenda the American people want.
"3.4 million permanent job losses. . . Nearly 30 million Americans are going hungry.. . Meanwhile, 3 members of the Walton family grew their wealth by $3.7 billion in a single day.. . Mitch McConnell and the do-nothing Republican Senate refuse to help the working class. Pathetic."
Hearing what’s on the minds of young people in Memphis before we march for #MLK50.
Oil company revenues since last year:. . Exxon: ⬆️ 57%. . Chevron: ⬆️ 84%. . Shell: ⬆️ 49%. . BP: ⬆️ 45%. . We cannot allow big oil companies to continue to take advantage of the war in Ukraine & inflation to make huge profits by jacking up gas prices. We need a windfall profits tax.
"Dental care is health care. We must expand Medicare to include dental, hearing aids & eyeglasses. 71% of Black Medicare recipients, 65% of Hispanic Medicare recipients, 70% of low-income enrollees and 59% living in rural areas did not see a dentist in the past year. Unacceptable."
"Instead of spending more money on weapons of mass destruction designed to kill as many people as possible, maybe—just maybe—we should invest in improving lives right here in the United States of America. That's what my amendment is all about."
Here's something I wish Tim Scott and Ted Cruz would understand: Corporate tax cuts don't create jobs. #TaxDebate
"Today, the 3 wealthiest Americans own more wealth than the bottom half of our people, and income and wealth inequality is worse now than at any time since the 1920s. This is a moral outrage and bad economics. Not acceptable."
I stand in solidarity with the @TPINUnion workers who are organizing to form a union. . . TPIN must respect the constitutional right of its employees to form a union and should immediately recognize the union.
"Some people ask, “Well, Bernie, how can we afford to act on climate change?” The real question is: how can we afford NOT to act while climate change causes so much destruction and suffering?"
Disability rights are civil rights. It's time to #DemolishDisabledPoverty once and for all. We must expand SSI.
Representative Jayapal is exactly right. There is no such thing as a limited nuclear war. The $13 billion cost of this nuclear weapon would be much better spent fighting poverty and rebuilding the middle class. Thank you for standing up to the military industrial complex.
"I am proud to have fought over the years for the idea that health care is a human right—not a privilege. When we pass Medicare for All, it will be because millions of people, over decades, created an unstoppable grassroots movement for justice."
That's great news. We need an Interior Secretary who has the guts to take on fossil fuel CEOs whose greed is destroying the planet. We need an Interior Secretary who will protect our environment. I'm confident Deb Haaland is that person and I am proud to support her nomination.
It is incomprehensible to me that we have a president who gave massive tax breaks to billionaires but wants to cut the WIC nutrition program for low-income pregnant women and their babies.
"Big banks know fossil fuels cause climate change..  . But JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citibank are still trying to profit off the product that is destroying our planet.. . To stop climate change, we have to stand up to Wall Street."
"We have got to join the rest of the developed world and abolish the death penalty. Too many innocent people, particularly people of color, get caught up in this unjust policy. A civilized society should not be involved in the murder of other Americans."
It is outrageous that Trump deployed American troops into harm's way to guard Syrian oil wells. Why? He said he wants to make a deal with ExxonMobil to sell that oil. . . This is illegal and unconstitutional. We must rein him in and stop these endless wars.
"In the richest country in the world, no child should be poisoned by contaminated water coming through their faucet. What has gone on in Flint, where 30,000 kids have been exposed to neurotoxins, is a crime and an obscenity."
"Now, at a time when Kaiser is sitting on $44.5 billion in cash reserves and your insured membership has grown to 12.5 million, the company wishes to diminish the safety and wellbeing of its workers, rather than improve them. That’s just not right. Your employees deserve better."
"Congrats to the House Progressive Caucus and other Dems who insisted that Congress pass BOTH the Infrastructure Bill and the Reconciliation Bill. Now is the time to stand with working families and take on the greed of Pharma, the fossil fuel industry and the billionaire class."
"During this pandemic, nearly 40 million have lost their jobs.. . How are billionaires doing? They got $434 billion richer.. . The ultra-rich have been waging a war on the working class of this country. It’s time working people stand up, fight back, and win."
Tomorrow @RBReich will join the Senate Budget Committee to testify about the soaring income and wealth inequality crisis in America and how we can build an economy that works for all of us.
"While the country has been fixated on the Kavanaugh nomination, House Republicans just passed another tax cut windfall for the wealthy, as if their $2 trillion giveaway last year wasn't enough. Shameful."
Our corrupt campaign finance system is increasingly controlled by billionaires and special interests. We must fight this drift toward oligarchy. The future of our democracy is at stake.
This school teacher is one of many millions of Americans who is being crushed by insurmountable student debt. More than 1 million people default on their student loans each year. We have got to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
Trump wants a shutdown. These are the major issues that have to be dealt with to stop him from getting his way.
Cardi B is right. If we are really going to make America great we need to strengthen Social Security so that seniors are able to retire with the dignity they deserve.
It's not a radical idea to say that women should get equal pay for equal work and the same economic opportunities as men. This is an issue of basic justice. #EqualPayDay
"The bottom line is: health care is a right, not a privilege. People should not be forced to live in pain or avoid medical treatment because they lack the funds. We need Medicare for all, and we need it now."
"What good is an order to shelter in place if you're homeless? This pandemic shows us that housing is in fact health care.. . As a matter of public health and justice, we must end homelessness and provide shelter to 500,000 Americans sleeping on the street."
People say climate action is expensive. But the price of inaction is far more costly. Intense heat waves could kill tens of thousands of Americans each year if we don't act. We must move urgently and boldly to transform our energy system.
"Climate disasters that can cause death, displacement and suffering—unprecedented heatwaves, storms, and flooding—now occur at a rate of one per week..  . If that is not an emergency, I don't know what is."
"The role of the United States should be to bring the peoples of the region together, not simply to support a right-wing Israeli government."
"Seniors on Medicare earn $26,200 a year but spend $5,500—20% of their income—on out-of-pocket health costs.. . Medicare for All changes that. We ease the burden on our seniors by covering:. . ✅ Hearing. ✅ Dental. ✅ Vision. ✅ Home care. ✅ All prescription drug costs over $200 a year"
"How can we possibly pay for tuition-free public colleges, universities and trade schools for every person in America?. . We could do it—easily—with the more than $70 billion that Congress added to Trump's Pentagon budget this year compared to under President Obama."
"Disney makes $9 billion in profits, gives its CEO over $400 million and yet Disneyland workers can't afford to put a roof over their heads."
"Sen. Manchin is right. Let’s cut drug prices in half by strengthening the provision in the House-passed Build Back Better legislation to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices like the VA has done for years, and pass the whole package with 50 votes next week. It's time to vote."
Congress does not regulate Wall Street—Wall Street regulates Congress. Break them up.
Billionaire Robert F. Smith's gift to forgive the student debts of the graduating class of Morehouse College was extremely generous. But the student crisis will not be solved by charity. It must be addressed by governmental action.
"About 900,000 people in Puerto Rico are still without power. It is well past time to build a 100% sustainable, decentralized, resilient power grid in Puerto Rico—instead of depending on outdated fossil fuel power plants that repeatedly plunge Puerto Rico into darkness."
"As a result of Trump’s decision to revoke DACA, 122 people every day are losing their legal status. We have a moral responsibility today to stand up for the Dreamers and their families."
"Trump complains about ""bad"" trade negotiators. But U.S. negotiators under both parties deliberately pushed through trade deals written by huge corporations designed to outsource millions of U.S. jobs and exploit cheap labor. . . We need fair trade to protect workers and our planet."
"In America today, if an employee is engaged in a union organizing campaign, that employee has a one in five chance of getting fired. That is unacceptable and that has got to change."
"Bloody Sunday inspired Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act.. . Outrageously, this historic civil rights law has been gutted by the Supreme Court.. . But this will not stand. Those who risked their lives in Selma showed when people stand together for justice, nothing is impossible."
We took some American doctors to Canada to see a universal health care system up close. Here's what they learned:
"During this terrible pandemic, when thousands of essential workers died doing their jobs, some 700 billionaires in America became nearly $2 trillion richer. But the working class is standing up and fighting back."
3.2 million more people are in poverty than official statistics show—how? Inflation is higher for the poorest than it is for the average person.. . This is more evidence of what we already know: the economy is rigged and it benefits the wealthiest the most.
"This billionaire thinks a high marginal tax rate on the rich has never worked in any country, ever. Has he heard of the United States of America?"
"To the nurses across America who are caring for our sick with unbelievable bravery and compassion: . . We stand with you. We will not stop fighting for the workplace safety, protective gear and the hazard pay you deserve. #NationalNursesDay"
This is an issue that impacts virtually every American. The American people have a right to know how companies are profiting from our information.
"The reality of today is that poverty is a death sentence in America. The wealthiest people live, on average, 10-15 years longer than the poorest.. . We must expand Medicare. We must invest in child care. We must pay workers a living wage. We must take care of our people."
"I don't hear bankers complain about ""big government"" when taxpayers hand them a trillion-dollar bailout.. . I don't see drug companies grumble when ""big government"" gives them patent monopolies to charge sky-high prices.. . I don't know who's more corrupt: Wall Street or Big Pharma."
"What do Amazon, Starbucks, Chevron, Netflix, GM, Duke Energy, Xcel Energy, Halliburton, Eli Lilly, JetBlue, U.S. Steel, FedEx, and Dow-DuPont have in common?.  . They all paid $0 in corporate taxes last year.. . We need government of, by, and for the people—not huge corporations."
"This is a positive step. US participation is unauthorized, unconstitutional and must end completely. I will soon bring SJ Res 54 back to the floor, so the Senate can end US participation in the Yemen war as a matter of law, not simply as a matter of the president’s discretion."
There is a health care crisis about to go down that virtually no one is talking about.
"At a time when millions of people are losing their jobs and their health insurance, the United States government must guarantee that you will have all of the health care you need."
"It is without doubt that as soon as this tax legislation is passed, Republicans will rediscover their religion about the deficit and say we need “entitlement reform.”"
"Republicans want a cold war with China because of its growing authoritarianism. That stance is coming from a party that refuses to acknowledge Biden's election victory, investigate the January 6th insurrection, and is working overtime to suppress the vote. What hypocrisy."
I stand with activists today who are telling the Supreme Court: Do not side with Louisiana in its war against women.. . We must keep fighting until the constitutional right to an abortion is secure.
"In a series of broken promises Trump made to the working people of this country, rejoining the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership would be the biggest yet. Rejoining the TPP would be a betrayal of American workers and a step in the wrong direction."
"It turns out that when you put people over profits, society is better off."
"When future generations ask us what we did to stop the climate crisis, how will we answer?"
"In an authoritarian country like Russia, protest is an act of enormous courage. I stand with the Ukrainian people against this war, and with the Russian people demonstrating against their corrupt, reckless president who started it."
"If Mitch McConnell could abolish the filibuster to appoint 3 extreme right wing Supreme Court justices who just voted to gut the Voting Rights Act, you know what? Democrats can and should abolish the filibuster to save democracy and make it easier, not harder, for people to vote."
"This is how we defeat Donald Trump's disgraceful bigotry and xenophobia. When billionaires use racism to divide us, we build solidarity among working people—immigrants and non-immigrants, gay and straight, men and women, black and brown and white."
"The free press is never more important than when it exposes wrongdoing by the powerful..  . That is why President Bolsonaro is threatening Glenn Greenwald for the ""crime"" of doing journalism..  . I call on Brazil to end its authoritarian attack on press freedom and the rule of law."
"Unless Republican Senators drop their objections to the coronavirus legislation, I am prepared to put a hold on this bill until stronger conditions are imposed on the $500 billion corporate welfare fund."
"When @RepCummings and I asked pharma CEOs about soaring drug prices, they coordinated to block our investigation.. . @MylanNews and @TevaUSA: Obstructing our inquiry is a crime. The American people deserve answers about your price-fixing conspiracy."
"Here is the bottom line: If we are to avoid another Great Depression, it is absolutely imperative that every worker in this country continues to receive a paycheck and benefits."
"Our education agenda will not tolerate billionaires like Betsy DeVos. Instead, we will:. . 🏫Stop privatizing public schools. 👩🏽‍🏫Fully fund public education. ❌Cancel all student debt. ⚖️Ensure that educators, parents, and students get the dignity and respect that they deserve"
"Prescription drug costs are too damn high!. . For decades, we've been paying more to pharmaceutical companies than any other country. You know what that makes us? The suckers of the world."
Congressional Republicans and President Trump are waging class warfare. We are going to stand up and fight back! #TaxScamBill
We cannot stand by as conspiracy theories about mail-in ballots and disinformation about Election Day results undermine public trust in the voting process.. . The Senate must act immediately to ensure the security of our elections.
We are in the midst of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. And the Republican-led Senate is doing nothing.. . Join me on the Senate floor to demand help for the working class who are hurting like they have never hurt before.
"President Trump, federal employees are not billionaires. They have to feed their kids and pay their mortgages. End the shutdown now and treat federal employees with the respect they are due."
The good news is that the vast majority of our people have a very different vision for the future of our country than what Trump and the Republican leadership are giving us. #BernieResponds
"The people of Louisiana are now facing 4 emergencies:. . ⚠️ A massive hurricane. ⚠️ COVID-19. ⚠️ Environmental racism. ⚠️ A massive petrochemical fire. . It's time to take on the fossil fuel industry, end environmental racism and provide these communities with all the help they need."
"7) Harold Pollack at the University of Chicago said: ""Over the long run, the Sanders people are very correct that you could implement a system like this that would be more disciplined, more economical and more fair than the current U.S. health system."""

"If Trump won't protect the U.S. from Russian interference in our elections, then my Republican colleagues must join with Democrats to make it happen or all of their tweets and speeches are worthless. I call on them to support my resolution."
You cannot tell me that raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour is a radical idea.
"""There are so many medical GoFundMe pages at this point that I can't imagine if pre-existing condition protections got repealed. We'd all be asking our family and friends for money."" —Sarah Rentz, 32 year old breast cancer survivor."
The disgrace of what has taken place with Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination will not be lost on the American people. We are mobilized from coast to coast.
Why are big CEOs trying to convince the American people that trickle-down economics works? We already know that it doesn't.
"It is outrageous, if unsurprising, that Trump would praise Putin’s murderous invasion of Ukraine as an act of “genius.” It should concern us all that Putin is exactly the kind of leader Trump would like to be, and that so few Republicans have the courage to say this out loud."
"The Walton family of Walmart is the wealthiest family in America, worth $180 billion. Middle class taxpayers should not have to subsidize Walmart’s horrendously low wages to the tune of at least $6.2 billion every year."
"Number of Americans arrested for possessing marijuana in 2019: 500,395. . Number of Americans arrested for violent crimes in 2019: 495,871. . In America, no one should get arrested for possessing marijuana. Let's end the drug war, legalize marijuana and expunge marijuana convictions."
"I am on the Senate floor with a compromise: Let us vote on both $2,000 survival checks and McConnell's alternative, and see where the chips fall.. . Working families need help NOW. Let us not go home until the American people see their Senators vote!"
30 million Americans don't have enough food to eat.. . 40 million tenants are struggling to pay the rent.. . 150 million Americans face serious financial problems.. . And the Republican Senate continues to do nothing except confirm more right wing judges. That is a national disgrace.
Robert Julian-Borchak Williams was wrongfully arrested because racist facial recognition technology misidentified him for a crime he did not commit.. . We can't allow this to happen again. It's time to ban facial recognition technology for policing.
Republicans love to say that corporations in the U.S. are paying the highest taxes in the world. They are dead wrong.
"The $1,200 direct payments to working class adults and $500 for children passed in March kept 3.3 million Americans out of poverty.. . Today, 1 in 4 workers are unemployed or make less than $20,000. Congress must provide direct payments to the working class NOW! At least $1,200."
The world's richest 1% have over twice the wealth of 6.9 billion people.. . The planet will not be secure or peaceful when so few have so much and so many have so little.
I’m once again asking my colleagues in the Senate to look at what is happening around the world and find the courage to stand up to the fossil fuel industry.
"I believe decent housing, good health care, and a quality education are human rights that everyone should have. . . Under our ruthless economic system, they are commodities whose costs keep rising as Americans’ wages stagnate. . . This is why we fight."
2010 Lindsey Graham wouldn't be supporting Graham-Cassidy. #HealthCareDebate
"How to fix a shortage of medical masks during a crisis:. . ✅ Utilize the Defense Production Act to make, buy and distribute masks. . ❌ Give $55 million to a bankrupt company that doesn’t actually make masks. . Trump's corruption and incompetence are costing lives."
I understand President Trump is blocking a resolution at the @WHO that would require drug companies to disclose actual R&D costs for pharmaceutical drugs. Nobody should believe Mr. Trump when he talks about taking on Big Pharma.
"Wealth during 8 months of the pandemic:. ⬆️$111 billion: Elon Musk. ⬆️$78 billion: Jeff Bezos. ⬆️$66 billion: Walton family. ⬆️$48 billion: Mark Zuckerberg. ⬆️$40 billion: Bill Gates. ⬆️$30 billion: Larry Page. . Meanwhile, tens of millions face economic desperation."
Last year American Airlines made $1.9 billion in profits. Its CEO Doug Parker is on track to make $31 million this year.. . They need to explain why 27% of workers at their subsidiary Envoy Air said they must accept food stamps and other public assistance to make ends meet.
@workerism This is exactly right. Wage theft is a crime and workers should stand up to it. We need a powerful labor movement to end the obscenity of businesses robbing billions of dollars from their own employees every year.
"The American people are sick and tired of police abuse without consequences. Congress must end ""qualified immunity"" now so that police can be held accountable for wrongdoing, just like everybody else."
"All over this country are decent people who tell their kids, don’t judge people based on the color of their skin or the country they came from. Judge them on whether or not they are good human beings.. . We have a president telling the world that's not what he does."
Young people did what they were told—they got an education and worked hard. Their reward? Millennials could face worse living standards than their parents.. . I asked for a government study on this crisis. This new research confirms my fears:
Senate Republican’s budget would cut $76 million from the Meals on Wheels program to give tax breaks to the top 1%.
"I'll be LIVE on the floor of the U.S. Senate at 4pm ET to explain why throwing billions of dollars at the profitable microchip industry, which over the last 20 years shut down hundreds of plants in the U.S. and eliminated 150,000 jobs, with no strings attached makes no sense."
"Yesterday the President of the United States lied about the deaths of thousands of American citizens for his own personal gain.. . Mr. President, try working with the people of Puerto Rico for a change, not against them."
Thanks to @iamcardib for calling attention to the importance of Social Security.
"Today, along with Rep. @BobbyScott and 181 House cosponsors and 31 Senate cosponsors, I'm announcing the Raise the Wage Act to bring the federal minimum wage up to $15 an hour.. . Watch our announcement live here:"
"We are living in an unprecedented moment in history. . . Now is the time to restore faith that the American government works for all of us, not just those at the top."
Enough is enough! No one in America should go deeply in debt or bankrupt for the crime of getting an education. It is time to reduce the burden of student debt and make public colleges and universities tuition free.
"If there has ever been a moment in American history when people understand the absurdity of tying health care to your job, now should be that moment.. . Whether you're employed or not, 3 years old or 93, health care must be a human right for every man, woman and child in America."
"It is unbelievable that this has to be said, but no: reducing testing will not make this pandemic go away.. . Trump's decision to pull federal support for testing is threatening the health of millions of people."
It's time to hold opioid manufacturers and their executives accountable for the crisis they have created.
"I know it is a radical idea, but maybe we should do what the American people want, and not what wealthy campaign contributors want."
"The most distressing aspect of our current economy is that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. When you’re working on starvation wages, it doesn’t take much to put you in serious financial trouble. We’ve got to take care of low-income workers in this country."

"If my memory is correct, this is exactly what the #NoDAPL movement warned about. It is why I stood with them in 2011 to oppose the expansion of the Keystone pipeline. . . We must clean up this disaster and immediately transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy."
"Climate change is the most pressing issue facing the world.. . Tonight I'm hosting a national town hall on climate change with @billmckibben, @Ocasio2018, @VanJones68, @shailenewoodley and more. . . Tune in at 7 PM ET:"
"It is not a radical idea to say that instead of throwing millions of Americans off of the health care they have, we must join every other major country on Earth and guarantee health care as a right, not a privilege, through a Medicare for All system."
Fraud is the business model of the military-industrial complex. The time is long overdue for us to stand up to their lobbyists and fight for the basic needs of working families throughout this country.
Trump’s plan to privatize our nation’s infrastructure is an old idea that has never worked and never will work. #BernieResponds
"As thousands of people take to the streets today to demand bold climate change solutions, people in Texas are facing serious flooding. Our thoughts are with the people in southeast Texas. We will do everything we can to help those communities recover."

"As President Biden considers his choice for Ambassador to Israel, I encourage him to choose someone who can represent our country in an even-handed way, and who can engage not only with Israel but with the Palestinians as well."
What the American people want is for us to work together and improve the Affordable Care Act—not destroy it. #HealthCareDebate
"No. There's absolutely no way Biogen should be allowed to charge patients $56,000 for the new Alzheimer's drug – costing Medicare up to $29 billion a year. We must take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry."
LIVE: Sen. Sanders speaks on how Medicare for all would help businesses and save billions of dollars.
"The crisis we face as a country is not because of voter fraud. It is because of voter suppression. If Republicans must intimidate and disenfranchise voters in order to win, then they should not be running for office in the first place."
"Poll after poll shows that the $3.5T reconciliation bill is immensely popular, despite what some television pundits might say.. . Let’s deliver for the American people. Let’s get it done."
"The 4 largest banks in this country (JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo) are on average 80% larger today than they were before we bailed them out.. . If these banks were too big to fail 10 years ago, what would happen if any of them were to fail today?"
"In some areas, like Morovis, Puerto Rico, 1/3 of the population is still without critical food and water supplies. This is unacceptable. We should not end our disaster relief until the humanitarian crisis is over. These American citizens deserve access to clean food and water."
"I believe that the United States must help lead the way to a peaceful and prosperous future for both Israelis and Palestinians. We need to take a hard look at whether the sale of these weapons is actually helping do that, or whether it is simply fueling conflict."
Bringing troops home from Afghanistan is a courageous decision by President Biden. There is more to be done to end the forever wars. @RepRoKhanna and I write about the next steps.
Unemployment rate:. 🇺🇸 13%. 🇬🇧 4%. . Why? The United Kingdom provided paychecks to its workers and kept them employed. It's about time we do the same.
The family that owns Walmart is worth more than $200 billion. The CEO of McDonalds received $18 million in compensation in 2019. Are we really supposed to believe they can’t afford to pay their workers $15 an hour? Absurd.
"I told my Senate colleagues loudly and clearly: Congress should be working 24 hours, 7 days a week until we pass a bill that addresses the pain and anxiety of millions of families throughout this country. Period."
"Maybe—just maybe—the most essential people in our economy are not hedge fund managers.. . If our farmworkers fall ill, we go hungry. We must put an end to their exploitation and provide free health care, paid sick leave, and good wages—regardless of immigration status."
"The wealthy must start paying their fair share of taxes.. . We must lower the cost of prescription drugs through Medicare negotiations.. . We must expand Medicare to cover dental, hearing and vision.. . We must expand Medicaid to improve home health care coverage."
"The current fight in DC is about more than a wall. It's about whether we are a nation of laws, where the president obeys the Constitution and democratic processes. The American people must inform Trump that we will not become an authoritarian nation."
I was right about Vietnam.. . I was right about Iraq.. . I will do everything in my power to prevent a war with Iran.. . I apologize to no one.
"What does a rigged, corrupt economy look like?. . Over the past 11 weeks, as 42 million workers lost jobs and nearly half of our people lost income, 630 U.S. billionaires increased their wealth by $565,000,000,000.. . Unfettered capitalism is not sustainable."
"By withdrawing from the Iran nuclear agreement, a move opposed by his own top security officials, Trump has isolated the U.S. from its closest allies and put us on a dangerous path to conflict. We should rejoin the deal and work with allies to effectively enforce it."
Do we really want to live in a country where students have to go to the hospital because of stress over paying for college? Or should we make public colleges and universities tuition-free while also lowering the outrageous levels of student debt?
"Pompeo told Congress the Saudis were ""protecting"" civilians as they bombed Yemen.. . Trump issued a fake ""emergency"" to keep selling bombs.. . A Raytheon lobbyist became Secretary of Defense.. . Thousands of Yemenis died, Raytheon profits went up.. . Trump is now covering up this crime."
"The six largest banks now have over $10 trillion in assets—54% of GDP. We must break up these huge financial institutions. If a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist."
Let me be clear: postal workers are heroes. Letter carriers like James Daniels risk their lives every day to ensure all Americans can get the necessities they need during this crisis. . . Congress must act to save the Postal Service and these essential jobs.
"That's funny. I didn't hear Sen. Paul worry about the deficit when he voted to give $1 trillion in tax breaks to the top 1% & large corporations. Yes. We should provide the working class with $2,000 a month during the pandemic like Canada did & repeal the tax breaks for the rich."
"Trump is right to talk about the need to rebuild our infrastructure, but his proposal is dead wrong. Trump would encourage states to sell our nation’s highways, bridges, and other vital infrastructure to Wall Street and saddle Americans with new tolls and fees."
"While millionaires and billionaires own 79.2% of all wealth in our country, the bottom half of Americans own just 1.5% of our nation's wealth.. . Justice Brandeis was right: ""We can have democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both."""
"Another 1.5 million Americans filed for unemployment last week while President Trump takes an absurd victory lap. How pathetic is that?. . The Senate should be acting with a fierce sense of urgency to provide everyone with income, paychecks, and health care during this emergency."
It's not just the Saudi-led war in Yemen or the brutal and cold-blooded murder of Jamal Khashoggi. It's the entire structure of the despotic Saudi regime.. . The time is long overdue for the U.S. to rethink its relationship with Saudi Arabia.
Today the U.S. Senate will vote on whether to end US support for the devastating Saudi-led war in Yemen. . . This would be the first time ever that the Senate has voted to end an unauthorized war. . . We must finally end US involvement in this humanitarian and strategic disaster.
July 2019 was the hottest month in recorded history. Make no mistake: this is an emergency. . . We cannot afford to simply wait Trump out. Congress must act boldly to tackle the climate threat—the fate of our children and grandchildren depend on it.

"This is what oligarchy looks like:.  . During the pandemic, while 12 million Americans lost health insurance and 54 million are food insecure, 644 billionaires became $931 billion richer and now own almost twice as much wealth as the bottom 50%. Yes. We need to tax extreme wealth."
"The truth about Yemen is that U.S. forces have been actively engaged in support of the Saudi coalition in this war, providing intelligence and aerial refueling of planes whose bombs have killed thousands of people and made this humanitarian crisis far worse."
A reminder from Fox News about the migrant caravan
"Somehow, we have billions of dollars available for more jails and incarceration, but we ""can't afford"" to provide kids with the college education they need to survive in modern America. That doesn't make any sense to me."
"As coronavirus ravages our communities and millions go jobless, Senate Republicans want to spend $740 billion on bombs and missiles.. . Dr. King warned that a society with these priorities is approaching spiritual death. It's time to cut the Pentagon budget."

This banking bill is a disaster. The Wall Street crash of 2008 showed the American people how fraudulent many of these large banks are. The last thing we should be doing is deregulating them.
"How can it be that six migrant children have died in U.S. custody in the last eight months? In the previous decade, this hadn't happened even once. . . We need an investigation. Trump's racism, xenophobia and incompetence cannot be allowed to continue."

"2) The Congress must move aggressively to protect our election systems from interference by Russia or any foreign power, and work closely with our democratic partners around the world to do the same."
President Biden is absolutely right. The big oil companies are making obscene profits gouging working Americans at an unprecedented level. Democrats in Congress should support the president’s fight against their greed and enact a windfall profits tax NOW.

Am I supposed to be impressed that billionaires are going to space while they’ve paid zero in federal income taxes some years? Nope. It’s time to invest in working people here on Earth.
"This woman's mother died of a self-induced abortion in 1944, when abortions were strictly criminal. In limiting access to abortion, all we are doing is eliminating safe and monitored abortions."
First: Instead of subsidizing COBRA — which would be a massive giveaway to the health insurance industry — I believe Medicare must be empowered to pay all of the health care bills of the uninsured and under-insured until this crisis is over.

"If you can’t stand up for a woman’s right to choose, for voting rights, for an economy that works for all, why are you caucusing with the Senate Democrats? We need a Democratic Majority where all members believe in economic, racial, social and environmental justice."
"What are our priorities when it takes 10 years to get food insecurity back down to a level before Wall Street crashed the economy?. . 1 in 9 families still go hungry in the world's richest country. If we are to end hunger, ordinary people must get involved in the political process."
"Iceland just became the first country in the world to make it illegal to pay men more than women. In the United States in 2016, black women made 62.5 cents on the dollar compared to white men and hispanic women made 54.4 cents. That is a disgrace."

It is not fair and it is not just that the two wealthiest people in America now own more wealth than the bottom 42%. I’m on the floor of the Senate NOW to demand action on the needs of our working families.
We are finally beginning to see some major victories in reforming our broken criminal justice system which has destroyed so many lives.

The release of the Nunes memo is a blatant attempt by House Republicans and the White House to disrupt the critically important investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.
Let me again thank the environmental community for helping to defeat the Big Oil side deal yesterday. But this battle is not over. The fossil fuel industry will spend millions to get Congress to approve some of their dirtiest projects before the year is over. We must stay alert.
"It is absurd that a billionaire in America today pays the same amount of Social Security taxes as someone making $147,000 a year. It is time to scrap the cap, expand benefits, and fully fund Social Security."
Very glad to do so. Health care is a human right.
"“I want to hear. I want to see. I want to be able to eat and smile.” . . It’s time to expand Medicare to cover vision, hearing and dental care."

Republicans are still trying to eliminate the Affordable Care Act. They couldn't do it through Congress because the American people rose up. Now they are going through the courts. Our job: keep up the pressure and stop them from kicking millions of people off their health care.
"While millions of Americans were waiting on unemployment benefits they were promised, Trump made time to meet with those suffering the most: Exxon and Chevron CEOs.. . If you’re an oil executive who desperately needs a handout, don’t worry! The president is here to help."
"While we honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice, we must also remember our veterans. As the former Chair of the Veterans Affairs Committee, I believe we must strengthen the VA and guarantee that all veterans receive the quality health care they earned."

"Where did the money from Trump's ""tax cuts for the middle class"" go? To wealthy corporations who have spent $1 trillion buying back their own stock to enrich executives and wealthy shareholders. That's not acceptable."
"Top oil and gas CEOs made $8,600 an hour in 2018—they got in *nine minutes* what ordinary Americans got as a one-time $1,200 coronavirus check.. . No, we do not need to bail out fossil fuel CEOs—we need sustained, economic protection for working families."
"My Republican friends tell us the only way we can ""strengthen Social Security'' is, in fact, to cut Social Security.. . Nonsense!. . Seniors cannot make it on $13,000 a year. When we talk about strengthening Social Security, that means increasing benefits, not cutting them."

"Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, says he is ""very proud"" of the working conditions at Amazon. Maybe he should listen to the story of this former Amazon worker who, after breaking her foot on the job, was told to take ibuprofen and finish her shift or go home with unpaid time."
"The American people, gun owners and non-gun owners alike, overwhelmingly support common sense gun safety legislation. It's time to act."

"When we landed on the moon, there was great collective pride in that achievement. Our space program should be something that we ALL take part in. We shouldn’t hand over $10B in corporate welfare to Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk, who are jointly worth $350B, to fund their space hobby."
"The Labor Department's job now is to make sure millions of people get unemployment benefits immediately.. . We must also join the UK, France and other countries to directly fund workers' wages and stop more layoffs.. . We have got to tell our working families: You will be made whole."

My message to Jeff Bezos and Amazon is clear: These despicable anti-union tactics must stop. Every worker in this country has the right to join a union. Period.

What recent union victories tell me is that working people all over this country are sick and tired of being exploited by corporations that are making record-breaking profits. Workers are fighting for justice in a way we have not seen in years.

"Yes, facts matter. Delta workers don't make as little as $9 an hour. They make as little as $8.25 an hour. It's time for Delta's CEO to stop misleading, stop discouraging workers from joining a union and pay all of them a living wage with good benefits."
"How pathetic. While Senate Republicans tell us we can't afford to give $2,000 a month to the working class during the economic crisis, the COVID-19 ""relief"" bill they just released provides $161 million in corporate welfare to the coal industry during a climate emergency."
Republicans are getting very nervous because we’re fighting for an extremely popular set of proposals that are long overdue. Let’s get it done.

John Lewis inspired millions to fight for justice. His courage helped transform this country. He won’t ever be forgotten by those who believe America can change when the people stand together and demand it. Our thoughts are with his loved ones.
"You would think that Trump’s Secretary of Homeland Security might have met with a single Dreamer before planning to throw 800,000 of them out of the country."
This is a long overdue rebuke from the United Nations Human Rights Council of Saudi Arabia’s atrocious record on human rights. The United States should put pressure on the Saudi regime to release imprisoned activists and end its persecution of dissidents.
"The House of Representatives rightly carried out its constitutional responsibility by voting to impeach Donald Trump, the most corrupt president in our history. No one, including the president, is above the law."
"Universal health care in America is not a radical idea anymore, thanks to the millions who have spoken out to demand a just health care system. 63% of American voters now support a Medicare-for-all health care system."
"The United States should be helping to bring the world together to develop a vaccine for this horrific pandemic.. . Instead, under Trump’s ""leadership,"" we don’t even bother to show up."
"If we are serious about calling ourselves a democracy, we need to end voter suppression and make it easier for people to vote. I applaud the House of Representatives for passing this legislation. The Senate must move quickly to take it up and pass it."
"CEOs say they want to make a social impact. Here's a way to do that: Instead of making 300 times more than their employees, maybe they should raise workers' wages and try getting by on 30 times more. Top CEOs in America did this not so long ago and somehow managed to survive."
"We all hope that the summit between Trump and Kim Jong Un is successful. Getting rid of North Korea's nuclear weapons through a credible process would be a major step forward for world peace. But when Trump praises Kim as “very honorable,” he makes a mockery of American values."
We have a crisis of public education funding in this country. Twenty-nine states gave less money to schools in 2015 than they did before the recession. That is outrageous. @IPS_DC
"Yet, tomorrow, the U.S. Senate will be voting on an annual defense budget that costs $778 billion – $37 billion more than President Trump’s last defense budget and $25 billion more than what President Biden requested."
LIVE: I'm on the floor of the Senate to respond to Sen. Rand Paul's budget proposal that calls for tax breaks for the wealthy and massive cuts to programs the American people need.
@Ilhan 75% of school districts have unpaid student meal debt. This bill will:. . ✅ Prohibit school lunch programs from denying children hot meals. ✅ Wipe out existing delinquent meal debt and stop harassment of families. ✅ Increase reimbursement rates to schools for meal preparation
"We must not hold the lives of 800,000 young Dreamers hostage in order to fund a wall that the overwhelming majority of Americans oppose. Sadly, it appears that is exactly what Donald Trump wants."
"Trump’s remarks last night were unusually horrendous. . . Dr. Ford has received death threats. Nazis have protested outside her house. Last week, she was forced to publicly answer questions about an experience so painful it still haunts her.. . And Trump's response was to mock her."
I am going to make a prediction. The major opponents of our legislation to cancel $1.6 trillion in student debt—mark my words—will be the exact same people who said we had to bail out Wall Street to the tune of billions upon billions of dollars.
"“Why does the U.S. pay the highest price in the world for prescription drugs? It is simply because of greed.” - Elia Spates of Derby, Vermont."
"The banks are still at it. This is the very same Wall Street recklessness that led to economic disaster and ruined millions of lives across our country. Unless we end their greed, American taxpayers will be on the hook again."
"JPMorgan Chase illegally charged 170,000 of their customers with bogus overdraft fees and regulators let them off the hook— no fine, no sanctions, no nothing. No. The government does not regulate Wall Street. The truth is Wall Street regulates the government. That must change."
I was right about Vietnam.. . I was right about Iraq.. . I will do everything in my power to prevent a war with Iran.. . I apologize to no one.
"464 days ago the House passed a $15 minimum wage. The GOP Senate refused to consider it.. . Since then, the 4 richest Americans increased their wealth by $189 billion & are now worth $522 billion.. . If there's going to be class war in America it's about time the working class won."
"If Republicans actually listened to those in need, like Cara Sachs, maybe they would understand that ""entitlement reform"" will devastate the lives of millions of Americans."
Congratulations to New Jersey and @GovMurphy for signing a bill today to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Now we must ensure a livable wage in all 50 states.
"Trump says he supports the working class. Really? Today, as a result of his cruel government shutdown, 800,000 federal workers worry about how they will feed their kids, pay their mortgages or see a doctor. Mr. President. End the shutdown."
"It will ensure our seniors can live in dignity by expanding Medicare to cover eyeglasses, hearing aids, and dental care."
The top 1% owe 70% of unpaid taxes. Collecting less than a third of those taxes can fund all of this:. . 🎓 Tuition-free college for all. 🏡 A Green New Deal for public housing. 🚰 Clean tap water for all. 🍝 Universal school meals. . Don't tell me we can't afford to live with dignity.
"In the richest country in the history of the world, no one should die because they can’t afford the medicine they need. NO ONE."
This is what strong oversight is about. The House is reclaiming its authority over war and blocking U.S. tax dollars from going to Saudi bombings in Yemen. Today's vote should make Donald Trump take a hard look at the despotic regime he loves so much.
"Norway ranks #3 out of 11 countries when it comes to health care outcomes, while Canada ranks #9. Guess who comes in last?"
"If he is confirmed, Brett Kavanaugh will be a rubber stamp on the Supreme Court for an extreme, right-wing agenda pushed by corporations and billionaires. We must do everything we can to see that he is defeated."
"We already have redistribution of wealth in this country. It is going the wrong way in the form of trillions of dollars to the top 1%. Yes, I believe it is time to change that."
"We take from the poor, we give to the rich: this is the philosophy of the modern Republican party."
It is absolutely outrageous that Donald Trump and Steve Mnuchin have still not approved grants included in the CARES Act to fully fund the paychecks and benefits of 2 million airline workers.. . @stevenmnuchin1: Stop delaying these grants. Pay the airline workers now.
It's no great secret Trump's FCC is a friend to corporate interests. That's why it set out to destroy a free and open internet. . . Mitch McConnell: make your case against net neutrality to the American people. But do not block the Senate from voting on the Save The Internet Act.
This is dangerous. Too many Americans have fought and died to defend American democracy to let President Trump act like an authoritarian.
"Since June of last year, 17 states have enacted 28 new laws that restrict voting access. . . Let's be clear. If we are serious about calling ourselves a democracy, we must make it easier for people to vote – not harder."
Donald Trump's ignorance on the climate change emergency is threatening the very lives of our children and future generations.
We will combat homelessness in America and address the reality that nearly 18 million households are paying over 50 percent of their income for housing by an unprecedented investment in affordable housing.
"I guess this is what Senator Mitch McConnell calls ""leadership"": Defending starvation wages for American workers, inaction on the climate crisis, and doing nothing to stop mass shootings."
We have a president who acknowledged on tape that he assaulted women. I would hope that he pays attention to what's going on and think about resigning.
Tune in now: @NYCMayor talks about what is being done in New York to help families get child care and affordable housing:
"I thank @jaketapper for admitting his “fact check” on Medicare for All was not factual and editing his video..  . Sadly, Tapper's video on Medicare for All along with other “fact checks” is riddled with errors peddled by the Koch-funded Mercatus Center. Let's go through them:"
"It's outrageous that multinational corporations are demanding billions in new corporate tax breaks, including $2 billion for Raytheon. Instead, at a time when child poverty is spiking, we need to focus on supporting low-income families by extending the expanded child tax credit."
"The people of Yemen are suffering because of a disastrous, brutal war. We should be ending that war, not funding it. On this issue and many others, I don’t see why we would want to be seen as a close ally of Saudi Arabia, which is a despotic, un-democratic regime."
"Mitch McConnell wants to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid to pay for Republicans' massive giveaway to the rich and large corporations. . . Enough!. . The American people must stand up and make clear to McConnell that we will expand, not cut, programs working people rely on."
I applaud Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes for sounding the alarm on the dangers of unchecked corporate power. We are living in an era of monopolies that dominate every aspect of our lives—including our government. It’s time to take that power back.
"I applaud @CTULocal1's teachers for achieving better pay, smaller class sizes, and more nurses and social workers in Chicago's schools. This is what solidarity is about—fighting for the whole community. .  . When workers stand together, I have no doubt we will transform America."
"This package, among many other things, increases direct payments by $1400, extends unemployment benefits, reduces child poverty by half, ensures we are vaccinating as many people as possible, and puts us on a path to safely reopen schools."
"For far too long, the United States health care system has put corporate profits over people's lives. That disgrace has got to end. #MedicareForAll"
"Today at 4pm ET, I’ll give remarks on the floor of the U.S. Senate congratulating @amazonlabor and @SBWorkers for their recent victories, and discuss the growing trade union movement in this country."
The wealthiest people in the country do not need a tax break. I’m live now with @SenatorMenendez to announce a compromise on the SALT deduction.
Does Senator Manchin not believe that at a time when we have a major labor shortage because our young people lack the skills they need that they are not entitled to at least two years of free community college?
"Our hospitals are getting overwhelmed. Our medical workers can't get basic protective gear..  . @realDonaldTrump: It is immoral to delay any longer. Enforce the Defense Production Act to immediately produce and distribute the masks, gloves, gowns, and ventilators we need."
"Rep. @IlhanMN is a leader of incredible courage. Sadly, these bigoted attacks are not the first she’s endured in her life. The vicious hatred directed toward her has no place anywhere, especially not in Congress. I urge the House Democratic leadership to take immediate action."
Abortion is a constitutional right.
The United States of America is not and must never be about locking up little children in cages on the southern border.
"Make no mistake about it: Canceling student debt is an act of social, racial and economic justice."
"Republicans are celebrating raising taxes on working families to give tax breaks to billionaires, corporations, private jet owners and themselves. Remember that."
"What Mr. Bezos has done today is not only enormously important for Amazon’s hundreds of thousands of employees, it could well be a shot heard around the world. I urge corporate leaders around the country to follow Mr. Bezos' lead."
Both @RepRoKhanna and I got involved in politics as young people because of our shared opposition to unjust war.. . We cannot let this generation experience horrors akin to Vietnam or Iraq. This is how we stop a war with Iran:
"Congratulations to activists for pushing the state to limit fracking in California. Fracking contributes to the climate crisis, increases earthquake risks and threatens our drinking water. Together, we can—and we will—ban fracking nationwide."
"In 2020, 45,000 Americans died from gun-related injuries. We’ve recently seen horrific mass shootings in Buffalo and Texas. The Supreme Court’s response: loosen gun safety laws. Six justices are way out of touch with reality."
"This American woman experienced what it's like to have universal health care in the UK, and guess what? Now she doesn't want to move back to the United States."
Tonight we're going to look at why the middle class has been in decline for 30 years while oligarchy is on the rise. #InequalityTownHall
How many times do we have to defeat Republicans' efforts to take health insurance away from millions to give tax breaks to the top 1%? Apparently once more.
I do not think we should allow ourselves to grow comfortable with the fact that the richest two people in this country own more wealth than the bottom 40% of Americans.
Working people are struggling.. . Their jobs don’t pay enough. . They have too much debt.. They can’t afford their prescription drugs.. The planet around them is becoming uninhabitable. . . Now is the time for the United States government to finally address their needs.
"Last year, one-in-five Americans couldn’t afford to buy the medicine prescribed by their doctor. Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies made billions in profits and spent hundreds of millions on CEO compensation. We must end their greed."
"Ady is fighting two difficult battles at once: one against the horrific disease of ALS, and another against the insatiable greed of the insurance and drug companies. When we pass Medicare for All, it will be because of heroes like him who stood up and fought back."
"Barack Obama was right. A gas tax holiday was a bad idea in 2008 and it's a bad idea today. If we're serious about providing consumers relief at the gas pump, let's take on the greed of big oil by enacting a windfall profits tax and ending OPEC's illegal price-fixing cartel."
“How can we afford it?”. . It’s a question critics ask any time I propose a bold new program like College for All. The answer in this case is very simple: with a small fee on Wall Street that will end reckless financial speculation.
"Today we need to remember: Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and the others who have come forward have done so with incredible courage, fully knowing that their character would be attacked and terrible things said about them. Their lives will never be the same. We owe them our respect."
"Before Social Security was created in 1932, about half of seniors lived in poverty. . . Today, the senior poverty rate is just 8.8% and in 2016 Social Security lifted 22 million Americans out of poverty. . . Our job is not to cut Social Security. Our job is to expand it."
"Trump thinks he can win votes by showing how tough he is on these little children being separated at the border. Well, that's pretty pathetic and his policies must be defeated."
".@SenTedCruz: ""Social Security is a Ponzi scheme"" #CNNDebateNight"
"By stopping the U.S. support that Saudi Arabia needs to carry out its bombings in Yemen, we can help end the world’s worst humanitarian crisis..  . I've passed an awful lot of amendments in Congress over the years, so let me tell you: this one is important."
LIVE: Sen. Sanders speaks at the University of Toronto on what the U.S. can learn from Canadian health care:
"In the wealthiest country in the history of the world, a higher education should be a right for all, not a privilege for the few. If we are going to have the kind of standard of living that the American people deserve, we need to have the best educated workforce in the world."
"The Senate GOP's plan to send checks will ignore many of our neediest:. . A couple making $150K—$2,400. A senior getting $18K from Social Security—$600. Undocumented parents with citizen children—$0. Someone living off disability payments—$0. A student in 2018 who just got laid off—$0"
"In the richest country in world history, our medical workers do not even have the masks, gloves, ventilators and protections they need right now.. . We need to fundamentally change the dysfunctionality, stupidity and irrationality of the current system."
"I wonder why Donald Trump vetoed our historic legislation to end U.S. involvement in the brutal bombing of Yemen. Who benefits from that?. . Raytheon, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and General Dynamics: the four corporations making 90 percent of the weapons that we sell to Saudi Arabia."
Providing an extra $300 a week in unemployment benefits to low-income families living in desperation is not radical. What's radical is that 719 billionaires became $1.6 trillion richer during the pandemic while the $7.25 federal minimum wage has not been increased in 12 years.
Let’s be absolutely clear about what Republicans are doing by adding work requirements to Medicaid: they are attacking the poor.
A life-saving prescription drug does not mean anything if you cannot afford to buy it.
"89% of Democrats & 79% of Republicans support expanding Medicare to include dental, hearing & vision care.. . 86% of Democrats & 70% of Republicans support providing seniors with home health care.. . This is what real bipartisanship looks like, even if all Republicans in DC vote no."
There’s no issue in front of Congress right now that is more critical for the future of our country than protecting the fundamental right of every American to vote.
"Trump’s executive order merely replaces one inhumane act with another. In response to the overwhelming public outrage at his policy of tearing children away from their parents at the border, this administration thinks the appropriate response is to indefinitely detain families."
"In the richest country on earth it's absurd that 75% of seniors who need hearing aids don't have one, 65% of seniors don't have dental insurance & eyeglass frames manufactured for as little as $10 cost over $230. We must expand Medicare to cover hearing, vision & dental care."
"You don't need a Ph.D in economics to know this, but it can't hurt: We need direct, monthly cash payments for everybody in America until this crisis is over."
"Is this a democracy or an oligarchy? Sheldon Adelson, a multi-billionaire, is contributing $176 million to elect candidates who represent the rich and powerful.. . Billionaires should not be buying elections. We must overturn Citizens United and move to public funding of elections."
"Here's what Senate Republicans said when they blocked President Obama's Supreme Court nominee. Do they have any integrity?. . The right thing to do for this vacancy is clear, and Senate Republicans know it. They've stated it clearer than I could."
"Medical workers trying to save lives have gone months without adequate masks, gloves, and gowns.. . Police officers cracking down on protest are fully equipped with rubber bullets, pepper spray, and tasers.. . Maybe it is time that we fundamentally rethink our national priorities."
"While Donald Trump and the ""masters of the universe"" assemble in #Davos, the 6 richest people own as much wealth as the bottom half of the world's population – 3.7 billion people. We need a global economy that works for all, not just multi-national corporations and the very rich."
"I congratulate the workers of Kickstarter, the first major tech company to vote for a union..  . These workers are setting an example for the entire industry. Tech employees deserve job security, strong wages and benefits, and a voice in their companies."
"It's no secret that the billionaire class dominates our political and economic life.. . To end poverty, homelessness, hunger and lead poisoning in America, the ultra-rich must pay their fair share. Even if that means buying fewer $89 million paintings and $70 million cars."
All because they are loyal to the Big Lie that Donald Trump won the 2020 election. He didn’t win. He lost. Period.
"Sen. Sanders, Rep. Ocasio-Cortez, and climate and housing activists lay out how we will transform public housing to create hundreds of thousands of green jobs."
"I believe that right now, the American people want real transformation.. . They want us to invest in health care, jobs and education for all, so that they can live their lives with dignity and security.. . They want a government which represents all of us, not the 1%."
This is very good news. @JoeBiden is moving quickly to address the climate crisis. Now Congress needs to aggressively act to transition our energy system away from fossil fuels.
"Republicans tucked in a $170 billion tax break for 43,000 people making over $1 million into coronavirus relief.. . That's more than all aid for states and cities.. . @RepLloydDoggett and @SenWhitehouse are right: We have got to repeal this obscene giveaway."
"Trump wants to do here what Orban has done in Hungary: weaken democratic institutions, curb press freedom, and rewrite election laws to entrench his own party’s power. The threat to our democracy could not be clearer, and we must act boldly to protect it."
"I want to hear the moral defense of a company like Disney that makes $9 billion in profits, $400 million for their CEO and has a 30-year worker going hungry."
On January 23 we're going to try to do something that's never been done before. I hope you'll join us.
Congratulations to the students who are standing up and speaking out today in the #NationalSchoolWalkout. Your leadership will move us forward. It's long past time for Congress to take action on gun safety to save innocent lives.
Why should we accept a reality in which the rich have so much while so many have so little?
"What if, instead giving tax breaks to billionaires and massive corporations, we gave 40 million Americans a raise by making the federal minimum wage a living wage of $15 an hour?"
"Trump said he wanted to get us out of Middle East conflicts. He lied. When we passed a bill to end U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen, he vetoed it. . . Congress must now defund all U.S. support for this war. Millions of lives are at stake."
"If the Postal Service is going to be a vibrant entity, we must end this Bush-era mandate. We must also allow the Postal Service to raise new revenue by offering innovative new services that the American people need, including basic banking services."
"Not ""all"" Americans—only the top 0.2% of Americans are affected by the estate tax. #CNNDebateNight"
"July was the hottest month EVER recorded on Earth. I'm growing tired of many people – especially my Republican friends – asking, “how can we afford to act on climate change?” The real question is: how can we afford NOT to?"
"12 million people lost their employer-sponsored health insurance during this pandemic. Meanwhile, health insurers like Anthem, Humana, and UnitedHealth doubled their profits from last year.. . Medicare for All means never losing your health insurance if you lose your job. Period."
I hope American Airlines CEO Doug Parker will come to our town hall tomorrow at 7 PM ET to explain why it's acceptable that he receives a huge compensation package while his employees struggle to afford food:
"Some say we can't afford tuition-free public college. . . Let me get this straight: 40 years ago, in an economy with half the income per person, some of the best public schools were essentially free. . . But guaranteeing college for all is so ""radical"" that we can't afford it today?"
"At a time of massive concentration of ownership in the financial sector, now is not the time to deregulate banks that have more than $3.5 trillion in assets and lay the groundwork for another massive financial collapse."
"Ed Schultz was a passionate defender of American workers and strongly supported trade policies that work for all, not just large corporations. For many years his voice has been strong, steady & against forces of corporate greed. Ed was a friend of mine and will be sorely missed."
"If President Trump is afraid of what an FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh will confirm or uncover, then the nomination should be withdrawn."
"The time has come to fulfill and expand upon FDR’s vision that he laid out in 1944.. . These are not radical ideas. They're supported by the majority of Americans. Working together, we can and we must achieve economic, social, racial, political and environmental justice for all."
A disaster. A joke. A lie. Here's how these millionaires describe the fraudulent trickle-down economic theory:
"On Monday night, I'll be joined by regional, security and nonproliferation experts for a live town hall on the consequences of Trump’s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Iran nuclear agreement. Tune in:"
This is pathetic. We should not be seeing 4 million Americans lose their health insurance. We should be guaranteeing health care for everyone through a Medicare for All program.
Pharmaceutical CEO salaries: . . Merck: $55 million. Pfizer: $50M. Eli Lilly: $30M. Johnson & Johnson: $26M. AbbVie: $23M. . This greed must end. The function of prescription drugs must be to protect and improve human health—not make corporate executives unfathomably rich.
"I believe in universality. That means if Trump wants to send his grandchildren to public school, he has that right. Wealthy kids go to public school right now. At the same time, we will make Wall Street, the top 1% and large corporations start paying their fair share of taxes."
"While psychologists tell us that ages 0-4 are the most important years of human development, we have a dysfunctional childcare system which underpays staff and is too costly for working families. We need universal, publicly funded childcare."
"For 87 years, through good times and bad, Social Security has paid every benefit owed to every eligible American on time & without delay. That's a h-u-g-e record of accomplishment. On this, the 87th anniversary of Social Security, our job is to expand Social Security, not cut it."
I don't accept people hiding behind the American flag to give tax breaks to the rich and throw billions upon billions of dollars at the military-industrial complex. Who is patriotic and who is not? It's an interesting question.
"Enough is enough. Republicans must compromise. It's time to stand up for Dreamers, working families and Puerto Rico."
The holiday shopping season is the most dangerous time of the year for Amazon warehouse workers. They suffer twice the injuries as the rest of the industry.. . @Ilhan and I demand that the Department of Labor stop this abuse.
"Instead of spending more on Trump's Space Force and a ""super-duper missile"" program designed to kill as many people as possible, let's invest more in health care, education, and housing for our people here at home. . . It's time to cut the Pentagon."
"I hope the CEOs of Amazon, Disney, McDonald's, Walmart and American Airlines have the guts to sit on a panel with their own employees at our town hall Monday night. Watch live on July 16 at 7 pm EST on my Facebook page."
Republicans’ budget is not a bad bill. It’s a horrific bill.
"Brazil’s new President Jair Bolsonaro is a far-right authoritarian who has praised the former military dictatorship and referred to black activists as “animals.”. . It's very troubling that Bolton sees Bolsonaro as “like-minded” with Trump. Even more troubling, he’s probably right."
The bill I'm introducing today would prohibit large corporations from buying back stock unless they:. . -Pay all employees at least $15/hr. -Allow employees to earn up to 7 days of paid sick leave. -Ensure CEO compensation is not more than 150x median employee pay. . #StopWALMART
John Bolton is the next National Security Advisor. That should scare everyone. Here are four reasons why:
It is unacceptable that some of the largest corporations in America have paid nothing in federal income taxes after making billions of dollars in profits.. . It is unacceptable that billionaires are now paying a lower effective federal income tax rate than the bottom 90 percent.
"Israeli children should not have to spend the night scared in bomb shelters, as many are doing tonight. Palestinian children should not have to grow up under the constant violence and oppression of occupation, as so many do, and have done."
Two protests. Two radically different responses from the President and police. See if you can spot the difference.
I am proud to partner with Republican Senator Mike Lee to pass our No War Against Iran Act. . . Defending the Constitution is not a partisan issue.. . We will do everything in our power to build bipartisan majorities in Congress to prevent this war.
Let us celebrate when we:. - Eradicate poverty. - Provide health care for all. - Abolish homelessness. - Combat climate change. - Provide Universal Pre-K.  . Let us not celebrate when:. - Billionaires who avoid taxes and exploit workers take a vacation to outer space.
"Wealthy TV ""experts"" are shaming millennials for buying coffee and avocado toast. But young people are broke because they’re drowning in debt and low wages..  . The ruling class wants to divide the young and old to distract us from an economy that’s rigged for the richest 1%."
"Instead of spending $20 billion to raise the minimum wage at Walmart to $16.66 an hour, Walmart is putting more money in the pockets of their wealthy shareholders. . . This is what corporate greed looks like."
Republicans: . ✅ Control the House. ✅ Control the Senate. ✅ Control the presidency . . Do your job. Run the damn government. Pass a budget that protects working families.
"What do I mean by a rigged economy? Here's what the past decade looked like:. . Wages of the top 1%: 📈+19%. $620,000 to $740,000 a year. . Median wage: 🏊🏼‍+2%. $18.40 to $18.80 an hour. . Minimum wage:📉-17% . $8.70 to $7.25 an hour. . It's time to put working people first instead of last."
"At a time when the demagogues want to divide us up, we must do exactly the opposite. We must bring people together. We must educate, organize and build an unstoppable grassroots movement that helps create the kind of nation we know we can become."
"Regardless of Trump's absolutely reckless decision, if you lose your job, you still qualify for the special enrollment period or you may be able to enroll in Medicaid.. . Go to for more information."
"When I look back upon American history I remember the two most significant foreign policy mistakes our country made in the modern era, and those are the war in Vietnam and the war in Iraq. And let us be clear, we were led into both of those wars by a series of lies."
Make no mistake about it. The Green New Deal is far less expensive than losing our planet to the greed of the fossil fuel industry.. . Medicare for All is far less expensive than the status quo that leaves 92 million uninsured or under-insured.. . The fight for justice goes on.
"Senator Dick Durbin: ""With what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?"". . Dr. Christine Blasey Ford: ""100 percent."""
"Americans – Democrats, Republicans and Independents – say that we must protect Dreamers. Congress must not adjourn until we have a fix."
"Trump knows mail-in ballots mean a larger voter turnout, which he does not want to see.. . That is pretty pathetic.. . My colleagues and I are working as hard as we can to pass legislation so that as many people as possible can safely participate in our democracy."
"As a corporate lawyer and lobbyist, Eugene Scalia made millions working for Chevron, Goldman Sachs, Facebook and other huge corporations, helping them undermine health and safety regulations. .  . So naturally he's Trump's pick to lead the Labor Department. Obscene."
"Memorial Day is a time to pay special tribute to service members who paid the ultimate sacrifice and to honor and support their families. We should be united in commemorating the sacrifices of those who gave, as Lincoln said, “the last full measure of devotion” to our country."
"A $15 minimum wage once seemed impossible. . . Since then, 6 states raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour. 29 states raised it above the national minimum of $7.25 an hour. . . Thanks to a strong grassroots movement, $15 has gone from laughable to inevitable."
"For too long, Congress has ignored the needs of the working class, the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor. Now is the time for bold action. Now is the time to restore faith in ordinary Americans that their government can work for them, and not the top 1%."
My friend @RepRoKhanna's excellent questioning of Michael Cohen confirmed that the president is very likely a criminal.
"The richest 1% is full of tax cheats. They are responsible for 70% of all unpaid taxes in America. . . If they just paid what they owe, we could build 26 million affordable homes—more than enough for every family paying half their income or more on housing."
"Under billionaire Eddie Lampert's watch 3,500 Sears stores closed and over 250,000 workers lost their jobs. Lampert must ensure a just transition for Sears workers who lost their jobs due to his greed. Workers deserve severance pay and to have their benefits honored."
We are saying to Mitch McConnell and President Trump: You are going to have to start dealing with the real issues facing this country.
"""There is no invasion. No one is coming to get you."" –Fox News Anchor Shep Smith"
"Record heatwaves worldwide. Hospitalizations, injuries, and deaths. Crops destroyed. Fires raging. . . Some say bold climate action is ""expensive."" Compared to what?"
It is the right of all people to speak out against their government. The government of Iran should respect this right and heed the voices of thousands of Iranians who are demonstrating across the country for better opportunities and a better future.

I will do everything I can to oppose this absurd set of priorities.
No mother should have to go through this. . . A vial of insulin costs about $5 to make. Yet people with diabetes are dying because drug companies charge as much as $540 per vial in the U.S.
I have serious concerns when you have a president of the United States who is constantly trying to undermine democratic institutions. That is wrong and together we must fight back.

"I say, with @MrDannyGlover, to Trump: We will not let you destroy a generational source of good, unionized jobs for the African-American community. We should modernize and expand the U.S. Postal Service to offer basic banking solutions—not privatize it."
"In the wealthiest nation, we must ensure all Americans, regardless of income, have access to mental health care. #WorldMentalHealthDay"
"The United States must play an aggressive role in bringing Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Egypt and the international community together to address Gaza’s humanitarian crisis and stop this escalating violence."
We are now at a crossroads in American culture. And it is an important one. The way we treat women in our country has been abysmal in almost every way.
"Last year, oil & gas companies made $174 billion in profits. This year they're on track to make more. We cannot allow big oil to use Ukraine & ""inflation"" as an excuse to rip-off Americans. I'm proud to join @SenWhitehouse to introduce a windfall profits tax. Let's get it done."
"Today marks how far into 2017 Latina women must work to make what white men made in 2016. That's a pay gulf, not a pay gap. #LatinaEqualPay"
It should be clear that we have got to do everything we can to stop guns from falling into the hands of people who should not have them.
Trump claimed that you need a photo ID to buy groceries. What he's actually doing is making the case for voter suppression.
"This is what oligarchy looks like: The drug companies, the healthcare industry, fossil fuel interests and the very rich are spending millions to defeat our legislation to protect working families and create a progressive tax system. Enough is enough. Their greed must be defeated."
"This should not be happening in the United States of America.. . In the richest country in the world, our physicians and nurses must have the protective equipment they need to protect their own lives so that they can continue protecting the American people."
".@realDonaldTrump, I have a challenge for you:"
I wrote a letter today with @SenatorLeahy and Rep. @PeterWelch to Postmaster DeJoy about the Postal Service’s continued failure to meet its own standards of service in VT. Postal employees are working remarkably hard and DeJoy must provide them with the equipment they need.
"The United States must rise to the moral challenge of our time: climate change. We can bring countries together, harness America's know-how to transition the world to sustainable energy, and protect our planet. That is what real global leadership is about."
We have got to end the embarrassment of being the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee paid leave. #FAMILYAct
Donald Trump doesn’t give a damn about the working people of America. His singular aim is to help his billionaire friends make as much money as possible. We need to take on the pharmaceutical industry whose greed is killing Americans and lower the price of medicine in half.
"Join me in a half hour, when I will speak on the Senate floor about my effort with @repmarkpocan, @RepBarbaraLee and @SenMarkey to reduce military spending by 10% and invest that money in communities ravaged by poverty, mass incarceration, deindustrialization and systemic racism."
"It is unacceptable that over half a million people in America, the richest country on Earth, are homeless."
What we are talking about exists in virtually every other major country on Earth. Think about starting a new business and not having to worry about whether your family will have health care. #MedicareForAll
"Trump's demonization of Latinos is racist, it’s wrong and it also happens to be factually inaccurate. Undocumented Latino immigrants commit fewer crimes in America than the general public."
This is what happens when you have a multi-billionaire who has never attended or taught in a public school as the secretary of education.
"More than a decade ago, advocates for working people warned that the WTO and unfettered free trade agreements would lead to the loss of millions of good-paying American jobs. Guess what? We were right."
There’s no question that authoritarian leaders around the world have drawn inspiration from the fact that the president of the world’s oldest and most powerful democracy shatters democratic norms and attacks the independent media and judiciary. #SandersSAIS
"Think of how corrupt our political and economic system truly is. Instead of worrying about jail time, the billionaire culprits of America's opioid crisis have the audacity to ask for millions in bonuses for their top employees.. . We need a political revolution in this country."
"We have a president today who not only thinks climate change is a hoax, but has officials meddling with scientific reports to argue that carbon pollution might actually be good for us.. . Trump's lies are a threat to a decent life for our kids and grandkids."
"Yemen is experiencing the worst humanitarian disaster in the world due to the Saudi-led war. . . The U.S. has been Saudi Arabia's partner in this horrific war. Too often, our weapons are being used to kill civilians. . . Today, the Senate can take a major step toward ending this war."

"On September 5, we are going to introduce legislation to end the absurdity of middle-class taxpayers having to subsidize billionaires like Jeff Bezos."
"I’ll be LIVE today on the floor of the U.S. Senate at 1:40pm ET. At a time when the working class is falling further behind and the billionaire class is doing incredibly well, it is time for Congress to stand up for working people."

"In the midst of a pandemic, the Senate is voting on a $740 billion Pentagon budget.. . I will be presenting an alternative: Cut the military by 10% to invest in health care, jobs, housing, and the environment.. . It's time to transform our national priorities."
Today my Republican colleagues along with some Democrats tell us that we should be spending our time deregulating some of the largest banks in America. How absurd is that?
"Millions of people are raising money on GoFundMe right now to fund their health care and life-saving medication. To my mind, that is not a functioning health care system. We must pass Medicare for all."
"I will vote against William Barr’s nomination. I cannot support someone for attorney general who will not make public the full Mueller report, who opposes a woman’s right to control her own body and who supports the failed war on drugs. Mr. Barr’s nomination must be defeated."
"For far too long, it has not been Congress that regulates the pharmaceutical industry. It is the pharmaceutical industry that regulates Congress."
"""I worry I will run out of food."" Listen to this mother describe what it's like to live on $7.65 an hour. . . I know a $15 minimum wage is radical to Republicans.. . You know what’s radical? That people working 40 or 50 hours a week live in poverty."
"In an act of moral cowardice, Congress handed Trump $738 billion for a Pentagon budget that arms submarines with ""low-yield"" nuclear weapons.. . Our military contractor friends are excited about this—they will make zillions of dollars—but I am not so sure working people are."
"Corporate greed is Kroger giving its CEO a 296% pay raise over the past decade, increasing profits by 23.5% in 2021, seeing its stock price jump 36% in the past year and spending $1.5 billion on stock buybacks and dividends, while 44% of Kroger workers can't afford rent."

"While 12 million Americans recently lost their health insurance, the private health insurance companies are making record profits during this horrific pandemic.. . Healthcare must no longer be a privilege or an employee benefit in America. It must be a human right. #MedicareForAll"
"The Arab Spring rose up to fight corruption, repression, inequality and austerity. The Lebanon and Iraq protests show this spirit is still very much alive. If we want a progressive future, we need to build up a global movement of and for working people."
"Anyone who tries to suppress the vote is simply a coward. If you can't win an election based on your ideas, then get the hell out of politics."
More than 1.5 million children went homeless during the school year.. . Three people now own more wealth than half of America combined.. . Is this the kind of society and economy we want to live in?

"As a member of the tax conference committee, I will do everything I can to defeat this bill. We need to rebuild the disappearing middle class, not provide more tax breaks to billionaires."
John Bolton was part of the effort to mislead the US into the disastrous Iraq war and has supported military action against North Korea and Iran. He was too extreme to be confirmed as UN ambassador in 2005 and is absolutely the wrong person to be national security advisor now.
"Are you a student or recent graduate? Apply for a paid internship in Senator Sanders' Burlington and Washington, D.C. offices by June 30."
"Can you believe it? Amazon is issuing credit cards with 28% interest rates to ""help"" people with bad credit. This kind of greed makes the poor even poorer and @AOC and I intend to outlaw it. Corporations will have to survive on a 15% cap on interest rates."
Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is a dire threat to:. . -Abortion rights. -Campaign finance reform. -Voting rights. -Workers' rights. -Health care. -Climate change. -Environmental protection. -Gun safety. . He cannot be given a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court.

American taxpayers put tens of millions of dollars into developing remdesivir. Any coronavirus treatment or vaccine must be made free for everybody.. . We will not tolerate profiteering by Gilead or any other pharmaceutical corporation right now. Human life comes first.
"""The whole myth that if you like your current insurance you can keep it - you know that is just not true."" . . This man suffers from 'job-lock' because he cannot afford to forgo his employer-based insurance. Our health care system is broken. That is why we need Medicare for All."
"I oppose the intervention of Bolivia's security forces in the democratic process and their repression of Indigenous protesters. When the military intervened and asked President Evo Morales to leave, in my view, that’s called a coup."
Republicans say they don't want to hurt Medicare. Then why does their budget cut Medicare by hundreds of billions of dollars?
"It's appalling that 10,000 people with disabilities died last year awaiting a decision from the Social Security Administration. This spending bill is a start to address the underfunded SSA, but we must keep working to expand and strengthen Social Security."
"We need to build a health care system that puts the lives of patients over the whims and profits of insurance companies, where being poor or unemployed or just unlucky doesn’t mean a death sentence."
The coal industry's own research predicted melting polar icecaps and flooding of major cities due to global warming. In 1966.. . We will look back at the decades of corporate lies and greed blocking climate action as one of the great crimes in history.
"Young people all over the world are demanding action on climate change, like @GretaThunberg, who had the courage to demand that the world’s corporate elite do their part to address this global crisis."
"The federal government bailed out the banks. Trump and the Republicans gave huge tax cuts to the wealthy. Congress is about to hand $10 billion to Jeff Bezos to go the moon. Yes, we can afford to cancel all student debt."
"Trump's strategy of hateful rhetoric and trying to divide the American people up is nothing new. It has been used by authoritarian leaders all over the world. Our job is stand together, fight back, and create the kind of country that we all know we can become."
"Instead of firing employees who want justice, maybe Jeff Bezos—the richest man in the world—can focus on providing his workers with paid sick leave, a safe workplace, and a livable planet."
"I’m sure this will come as a big surprise to you: Trump’s phony rhetoric did nothing to stop skyrocketing drug prices..  . We need a president who will stand up to the greed of Big Pharma instead of appointing a pharma CEO to ""oversee"" that very industry."
Poll after poll after poll tells us the overwhelming majority of Americans don't want cuts Medicare or Medicaid.

"It is incomprehensible that we have governors continuing to do business as usual rather than issue stay-at-home orders.. . If they're not able to do it, the federal government should."

"Well, what do you know? One of the Wall Street ratings agencies complicit in the worst financial crash in modern history is warning of the dangers of bailing out students—not the crooks who run the big banks. .  . Thanks for the advice. But we are going to cancel all student debt."

"If the founder of Starbucks can become nearly $2 BILLION richer during the pandemic, yes, Starbucks can afford to pay its workers a living wage."
"The Koch family is worth $113 billion, becoming $22.6 billion richer over the past 7 months. They could literally end child hunger and homelessness in America and still be billionaires. Instead they're trying to evict millions of poor people from their homes. How obscene is that?"
I'm LIVE with @GovPhilScott to discuss how the American Rescue Plan will help working Vermonters.
"During the campaign, Trump promised to protect Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Now Congressional Republicans are getting ready to cut them."
"At a time when 71% of the American people support raising income taxes on the top 2 percent and 65% of our people want to increase taxes on large corporations, it is time to take on the greed of the ruling class. Period."
I say to the Walton family of Walmart: The American people are sick and tired of subsidizing your greed. Get off of welfare and pay your workers a living wage.
"I’m from Brooklyn. New York wouldn’t be one of the greatest cities in the world without the 40,000 transit workers @TWULocal100 who run the bus and subway systems. They keep New York moving and deserve a fair contract with good wages, benefits and job security. #TWURally2019"
"I said it in 1993 and I will say it again now: If you want a simpler, more cost-effective health care system, the way forward is a Medicare for All, single-payer program."

"If you paid $12.99 a month for an Amazon Prime membership, you paid more to Amazon than it paid in federal income taxes over the past 3 years combined. .  . On this #PrimeDay, let us stand with Amazon workers. Let us demand that billionaires pay their fair share."
"Right now, millionaires and billionaires pay the same amount of money into Social Security as someone making $133,000.. . Why does the burden of Social Security taxes fall more heavily on those who make less? That is wrong and it has got to change."
Disgraceful. Pathetic. I have a few things to say about Trump's tax proposal.
Methane is a greenhouse gas 86 TIMES more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere.. . President Trump is apparently comfortable with the destruction of our planet if it means he can hand favors to fossil fuel industry billionaires.
"Mnuchin's economics experience? Being called the ""Foreclosure King"" for heading a bank that kicked 50,000 families out of their homes.. . Keep going, Greta. Scientists tell us we must transform our economy to save the planet. Economists say we'll create millions of jobs doing so."
The average cashier at McDonald's would have to work for 895 years to earn what the CEO makes in a year. Corporate greed has got to end. No more paying workers starvation wages.
This is the reality of working at Amazon. #CEOsvsWorkers #PrimeDay
We cannot go back to the days when people could be denied insurance due to a pre-existing condition. We will fight any Republican efforts to end these protections.

"LBJ’s administration misled Congress and the American people into the Vietnam War, just as the Bush administration misled us into the Iraq War. . . Time and again we see disasters when leaders refuse to tell the truth and when Congress is not actively involved in finding the truth."
The millennial generation was told that the only way they would get good jobs is if they received a college education. That turned out to be dead wrong. Wages for the average college graduate have stagnated. It's time to hit the reset button. Here's how:
Don't just weep. Fight for a progressive agenda to reduce income and wealth inequality.
"The median Amazon employee makes $13.67 an hour.. . Many of those employees rely on food stamps, Medicaid and public housing to survive.. . You know who pays for that? You do.. . You know what Jeff Bezos makes every hour? $10,833,33. . It's time for Amazon to get off corporate welfare."
We spend twice as much per capita on health care as any other nation but with worse health outcomes for our people. Does that make sense to anyone? It’s time for Medicare for All.
"Since March of 2020 Mr. Bezos became $65 billion richer.. . He has enough money to own a $500 million, 417-foot mega-yacht. . . He has enough money to buy a rocket ship to blast William Shatner to outer space. . . Yes, he can provide decent working conditions."

"The CEO of @kroger got paid $21.1 million a year as its workers struggle to get by on $26,000.. . Kroger got a 30% boost in sales in March, but is ending $2-an-hour hazard pay.. . Disgusting. It can damn well afford to pay grocery workers a dignified wage as they risk their lives."
Corporate greed is Moderna giving its CEO a $923 million golden parachute & handing out $360 million in stock options to 2 top executives after receiving $2.5 billion from U.S. taxpayers to develop its COVID vaccine & refusing to share it with the world. We must end this greed.

"""This is flirting with fascism in the open, in broad daylight now."" –@SanhoTree of Institute for Policy Studies on Trump's demonization of immigrants."
If there's a lesson that should be learned now it is that moving quickly to renewable energy is not just an environmental issue. It is a matter of national security. We must deny Putin and other petro-dictators the ability to hold the global economy hostage. The time is now!
Republicans used the budget process to give trillions of dollars in tax breaks to the wealthy and powerful. We’re going to use it a little bit differently and finally invest in the long-neglected needs of the working class.
Things that are national emergencies:. -30 million without health insurance. -15 million children in poverty. -Tens of thousands dying from opioids and gun violence. -Climate change. . Things that are not national emergencies:. -Building a border wall to satisfy Fox News
"It makes no sense for young people to be denied jobs because they were arrested for smoking marijuana. It is time to legalize marijuana, expunge past marijuana convictions and end the failed war on drugs."
Let me congratulate the @fightfor15 movement for winning another historic victory.. . The American people understand that we must raise the federal minimum wage from a starvation wage of $7.25 an hour to a living wage – at least $15 an hour. . . And that is exactly what we'll do!
"There is an enormous amount of work to be done as we transform our energy system away from fossil fuel and cut carbon emissions, and hundreds of thousands of members of the Civilian Climate Corps are going to be at the forefront of that struggle."
"Are our memories so short that we have learned nothing from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression just 10 years ago? Unbelievably, Congress now wants to deregulate some of the same banks that helped cause the 2008 financial disaster."
Judge Barrett could not even say Medicare and Social Security are constitutional or that climate change is real. What a disgrace.. . Senate Republicans are carrying out an illegitimate power grab. Today is a shameful day for our democracy.. . I will vote NO on her confirmation.
"It’s a national disgrace that a minimum wage worker cannot afford a modest one-bedroom apartment in 99% of counties in America. All Americans have a right to a decent, affordable home."
"Amazon is worth $1 TRILLION.. . Jeff Bezos is worth $155 BILLION.. . Thousands of Amazon workers have to rely on food stamps, Medicaid and public housing to survive. . . That is what a rigged economy looks like. Tomorrow we will introduce a bill to end subsidies for low-wage employers."
"During the peak of the pandemic, in 2020, your company made $2.2 billion in operating profits. Let’s be clear. Those company profits did not occur by accident. They occurred because your employees were on the job, working tirelessly in the midst of a life-threatening pandemic."
The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and millions of others who fought against the Dakota Access Pipeline showed us the power of standing together against injustice.. . We can create a future where a clean environment and indigenous rights matter more than Big Oil’s profits.

"$282,000,000,000.. . That's by how much America’s billionaires increased their wealth in less than a month, while over 22 million lost their jobs.. . This system of unfettered greed is morally obscene. It’s time to put working families first—not billionaires."
"Maybe, just maybe, Congress might want to serve the needs of the American people, and not wealthy campaign contributors. A new CBS poll finds overwhelming support for these provisions in the $3.5T Reconciliation Bill."
"A quarter of a million Americans have died from coronavirus.. . Over 150,000 people are getting infected every day.. . We need Masks for All."
"Transgender people have served and continue to serve our country honorably in the military. Unfortunately, this administration is not treating them honorably. The struggle for equality for all Americans continues, and Trump's efforts to divide us will not succeed."

LIVE: The Saudi government is waging a devastating war in Yemen and repressing its own people. We should not be rewarding them with more weapons of war. I’m on the floor of the Senate NOW to block an arms sale to this regime.
"The American people have been clear:.  . 88% support lower prescription drug prices.. 84% support Medicare coverage for dental, vision, and hearing.. 73% support paid family and medical leave..  . Here’s a radical idea: Let’s listen to the American people. Let's get it done."
"Why does Trump want to repeal the estate tax? Maybe because without it, a majority of the assets held by households worth $100 million or more would never be taxed..  . We must reduce inequality, not make it worse. Our job is to increase the estate tax on billionaires like Trump."
"Republicans control the House, Senate and White House. They have to pass an annual budget, not more one-month continuing resolutions. We need a bipartisan solution to the economic crises facing the middle class, to the DACA crisis that Trump created and to disaster relief."
"The biggest threats that we face today—climate change, inequality, rising authoritarianism, and a refugee crisis—do not have military solutions.. . It's time to stop spending trillions on endless wars and get to work on things that will help America succeed for future generations."

Jane and I wish everyone a Happy Valentine's Day filled with love and compassion.
I sent a letter with 16 of my colleagues today asking President Biden to propose in his American Families Plan the most significant expansion of Medicare since it was signed into law to improve the lives of millions of Americans.
Bringing people together to resolve conflicts without war is not weakness - it is strength.
"As Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, I am proud that we passed the American Rescue Plan, which, in my view, is the most significant piece of legislation to benefit working families in the modern history of this country."
"Today, someone who makes $147,000 a year pays the same amount of Social Security taxes as a millionaire or billionaire. Does that make sense to you?"
"We live in a country which can provide literally hundreds of millions of dollars to CEOs, and yet we have teachers who have to take money out of their own pockets to buy school supplies.. . If we believe in the future of this country, we have got to believe in our educators."
"During this public health crisis, the Senate must also pass legislation to empower Medicare to pay all of the medical bills of the uninsured and the under-insured—including prescription drugs—for the duration of the pandemic."

"Amazon #PrimeDay sales are nice, but not if they come at the expense of worker safety. The Department of Labor must #InvestigateAmazon."
"Physical infrastructure is terribly important. But I also think that the needs of the human beings of our country – working families, the children, the elderly, the poor – are even more important. . . We can and must take care of both."
"Yesterday, conservative House Dems committed to voting for the Build Back Better Act no later than the week of Nov. 15th. Their constituents are watching. They must keep that promise. No excuses. Every Democrat must vote to address the needs of working families & climate change."
Climate change is the existential crisis of our time. Why isn't this something we talk about on the news every day?
"This is not right: When it comes to who can afford to pay off their college debt and move on with their lives, there is a significant racial gap..  . Our job is to make public colleges tuition-free and substantially reduce student debt in this country."
Congratulations to Donald Trump for unintentionally making the case for Medicare for All.
"This is insane: As Oklahoma and Arkansas face catastrophic flooding, and Ohio and Indiana reel from tornados, Trump is trying to undermine the very science that proves climate change is real. We need policy based on facts, not rightwing ideology."
"Think for a moment—that instead of spending well over a trillion dollars on weapons of destruction, we could be spending that money on transforming our energy system and protecting the planet. #ClimateTownHall"

Americans are forced to pay the highest prices in the world for the medicine they need as a result of the incredible wealth and political power of the pharmaceutical industry. That is not acceptable.
"600,000 people, disproportionately people of color, were arrested for possession of marijuana in 2017.. . It is time to decriminalize marijuana, expunge past marijuana convictions and end the failed war on drugs."
"While you were feeling pain at the pump, Shell, Exxon, and Chevron raked in $46 BILLION in profits over the last three months and said they would spend up to $47 billion on stock buybacks after spending $18.8 billion so far this year. Yes, it’s time for a windfall profits tax."
"Facebook has incredible power over the economy and our political life. It harvests the data of 228 million Americans and, over and over, uses this sensitive information in dangerous ways. What we need is vigorous antitrust action and to break Facebook up."
I say to Mitch McConnell: Do not ignore the will of 200 million Americans who want us to put an end to starvation wages in the United States.. . Let the American people have a vote on a $15 minimum wage!
"People who deserve pardons: 450,000 non-violent drug offenders.. . People who don't deserve pardons: Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, Charles Kushner, Duncan Hunter, Joe Arpaio & the Blackwater guards who massacred civilians in Iraq.. . Yes. Trump is the most corrupt president in history."
The DMV should not use its trove of personal information as a tool to make money. Nobody—from agencies like the DMV to large corporations like Facebook and Google—should be profiting from sharing or selling personal information without meaningful consent.
Nurses know better than anyone how our for-profit health care system is incompatible with health care itself. I applaud @NationalNurses for their leadership to guarantee health care is a human right for all.
I said it in 1993 and I'll say it again today: D.C. statehood now!
We have very little time to save American democracy from Republican voter suppression and extreme gerrymandering. EVERY Democrat must support ending the filibuster in order to pass the voting rights act.
"It’s hard to imagine that Israel’s Netanyahu government would have passed the recent “Nation State law,” which essentially codifies the second-class status of Israel’s non-Jewish citizens, if Netanyahu wasn’t confident that Trump would support him. #SandersSAIS"
"Today the Senate will be voting on my amendment that says clearly: Cut the Pentagon budget by 10%. Invest in jobs, education, housing and healthcare here at home. #PeopleOverPentagon"
The system is rigged against working people.
"Why, in the richest country in the history of the world, aren't we treating ending hunger in America like a top priority?. . We must substantially expand the Meals on Wheels program, school meals programs, and SNAP benefits."
"Climate strikers, led by our young people, are on the march for environmental justice. They are changing our national conversation and building an unstoppable movement. Together, we will transform this country and pass a Green New Deal."
We have to decide as a nation whether information about what we do with our lives should be sold to companies that will exploit that information.
"At a time of massive wealth and income inequality, when the 3 wealthiest people own more wealth than the bottom half of our country and 46% of all new income goes to the top 1%, Americans want the rich to pay their fair share of taxes."
The only way working people can win is when they stand together. That’s what solidarity is all about.
"If you pay $75 a month for an AT&T cell phone plan, you paid more to AT&T than it paid in taxes last year – a company that made $30 billion in profits in 2021 while receiving a $1.2 billion tax refund from the IRS."
This is a major victory for grassroots activists and a blow to Trump’s hideous effort to end legal protections for our undocumented youth. Now we must quickly pass legislation to provide a path to citizenship for Dreamers and the 11 million undocumented in this country.
Amazon must recognize that workers' rights don't stop at the minimum wage. . . Amazon must significantly improve working conditions at its warehouses and respect the constitutional right of its employees to form a union and bargain collectively for a better life.
"I don't mind if @MarkRuffalo spoils his own movies. But please, don't ruin the surprise of our new legislation with Rep. @AOC, @SenJeffMerkley and @RepDarrenSoto.. . I don't want the dirty fracking industry CEOs to know what hit them."
No other country allows pharma companies to charge any price they want for any reason they want. That has to change.. . At the start of the new Congress @RepRoKhanna and I will introduce legislation to stop Big Pharma from ripping off the American people.
"Total student debt of 43 million Americans: $1.8 trillion. . Total wealth of 719 billionaires in America: $4.56 trillion. . Our job: Cancel student debt, make public colleges and universities tuition free and have the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share of taxes."
"The economic theory Trump has embraced, trickle-down economics, is a fraud and an abysmal failure."
"If we can spend $782 billion on the military industrial complex and handout $52 billion in corporate welfare to the profitable micro-chip industry, please do not tell me we cannot afford Medicare for All during a pandemic or the Green New Deal during a climate emergency."
Need further proof that the Republican tax bill is a massive giveaway to the largest corporations? The Republican tax bill hands 15 corporations a $236 billion tax break.
Who wants Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices? Oh just....  . 91% of Democrats. 85% of Independents. 76% of Republicans . 84% of seniors .  . Now is the time for Congress to finally have the courage to stand up to the greed of Big Pharma.
"We need to counter oligarchic authoritarianism with a strong global progressive movement that speaks to the needs of working people, that recognizes that many of the problems we are faced with are the product of a failed status quo. #SandersSAIS"
"Pharma executives allegedly deleted their texts and lied to our offices to conceal a conspiracy to fix prices, raising them by as much as 1000%. How many have died as a result of this racket? @RepCummings and I will hold these companies accountable."
"Hmm. When the GOP passed legislation to provide a $1 trillion tax break to corporations & the 1% without a single Democratic vote, I didn't hear my Republican colleagues say ""Wait. It has to be bipartisan."" Please don't tell me we can't use the same tools to help working people."
We can find common ground by taking on the pharmaceutical industry and lowering the costs of prescription drugs. #HealthCareDebate
"A question for Amazon: If you’re so proud of the way you treat your workers, why are you relying on so many temporary workers who receive low wages, unreliable schedules and no benefits?"
"I fully support these medical workers in Ohio, who are striking to make St. Vincent Medical Center put patients over profits. They are on the right side of history."
Trump and his friends believe in voter suppression and billionaires buying elections. . . We want:. ✅ Automatic voter registration. ✅ The overturn of Citizens United. ✅ Election day as a national holiday . . History is on our side. We will win this struggle.
Wall Street billionaires have cooked up a new scheme: buying up health clinics so they can charge unsuspecting patients insane “out-of-network” fees. That is pretty disgusting.
Yesterday Trump suggested that members of Congress who don't mindlessly stand and applaud his every word are guilty of “treason.” The great political issue now facing our country is not Democrat vs. Republican. It's about democracy vs. authoritarianism.
The voices of the Palestinians are rarely heard. This is what life is like for those who are living in Gaza under a 10 year blockade:
How can it be that the United States—with just 4% of the world’s population—accounts for 25% of the world’s coronavirus deaths?. . Our people are dying every day because of Trump’s lies and incompetence.
"According to my Republican colleague, corporations are people who can have unlimited influence in our elections. But if you're a low-income worker in Kentucky, we shouldn't make it any easier for you to vote."
"Even as Trump draws closer to authoritarian leaders like Putin, Orban in Hungary, Erdogan in Turkey, Duterte in the Philippines, and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, Trump is needlessly increasing tensions with our democratic European allies. #SandersSAIS"
"Unfortunately, Sen. McConnell has decided to go against Justice Ginsburg's dying wishes and is cementing a shameful legacy of brazen hypocrisy.. . The right thing to do here is clear, and Senate Republicans know it. We should let voters decide. Period."
.@SteveEasterbrk I hope you will come to our town hall on Monday to explain why it's acceptable that you receive a huge compensation package while McDonald's workers struggle to put food on the table. The invitation to our town hall is sincere:
The time is now to finally address the long-neglected needs of the working class. I'm LIVE on the floor of the Senate talking about why we must pass the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill.
"Three years ago, who would have imagined that the United States would refuse to take sides between Canada—our democratic neighbor and second largest trading partner—and Saudi Arabia on an issue of human rights. #SandersSAIS"
".@SpeakerRyan and @SenateMajLdr, how much will you cut Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security to pay for a $1.4 trillion deficit increase? How much will you cut Pell Grants, WIC and Head Start? The people have a right to know."
"We are producing enough to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to shelter the homeless, and provide what people need.. . And yet we have an economy which works day after day to make billionaires richer and turns its back on desperate people."
Let me be clear: billionaires do not need more tax breaks.
"It costs $30,000 to send a California student to UCLA for a year. To send someone to prison, it costs $75,000.. . We need to be a nation that invests in jobs and education, not jails and incarceration."
"I've said it before: Betsy DeVos is the worst Secretary of Education in modern history. Instead of standing up for victims of fraud, she is profiting off of them. Our country needs an advocate for students, not a billionaire working on behalf of predatory lenders."
"Poll after poll shows overwhelming support for the $3.5 trillion Build Back Better legislation. Yet, polling also shows that a majority of Americans have very little knowledge as to what is in this bill."
"China, with one-third our per capita income, leads on electric vehicles and renewable energy, while Trump says climate change is a hoax..  . A Green New Deal would invest in building our electric buses, trains and cars here in America with good union wages."
"Tonight at 7:15 p.m. ET, I'll be on the floor of the U.S. Senate to continue opposing a $10 billion handout to Jeff Bezos to go to the moon and a $53 billion giveaway to profitable microchip companies."
"Trump said he wouldn’t cut Social Security. He lied. He is working to stop Americans from getting the benefits they paid for and need.. . No, Mr. President: We will not let you cut Social Security. We will fight to expand it."
I met with some of Vermont's smart and talented young people - students participating in the @ALBoysNation and @ALAforVeterans Girls Nation. Looking forward to great things from these student leaders.
Our job is to demilitarize police departments so they do not look like and act like oppressing armies.
We have become far too comfortable with the United States engaging in military interventions all over the world. The time is long overdue for Congress to reassert its constitutional role in determining when and where our country goes to war.
The richest people on Earth should pay more than $0 in federal income taxes. Period.
"If we can bail out large corporations, we can ensure everyone in this country has the income to support themselves and afford basic necessities during this crisis. One $1,200 check ain't enough."
I’m LIVE on the floor of the Senate to pass a resolution supporting free and fair elections in Brazil. It’s important for the people of Brazil to know that the United States is on their side and on the side of democracy.
"We must hold Andrew Wheeler, Trump's new EPA secretary and an ex-coal lobbyist, accountable to enact bold and progressive measures to address the climate crisis."
Republican members of Congress are rushing to pass a bill that will increase their own personal wealth at the expense of the middle class.
It is time for the United States Congress to tell the despotic government of Saudi Arabia that we do not intend to follow their lead in their military adventurism. Speaking live now:
Our nation’s veterans have earned quality health care. I’m LIVE on the floor of the Senate to urge my colleagues to strengthen the VA so no veteran is left behind.
"Let’s be clear: another war in the Middle East could cost countless lives and trillions more dollars and lead to even more deaths, more conflict, more displacement in that already highly volatile region of the world."
Puerto Rico can no longer be treated like a colony. All Puerto Ricans must be able to fully exercise their right to vote.
"How in the hell does Carnival, a cruise ship company that pays virtually no federal income taxes, receive a bailout, but the Postal Service, the most popular government agency in America, does not?. . The Post Office is essential. Cruise ships are not."
Before Congress considers a tax bill it must investigate the Paradise Papers. We must end the rapid movement toward international oligarchy.
"All people have the right to protest and to live in a democratic society. I call on the Cuban government to respect opposition rights and refrain from violence. It’s also long past time to end the unilateral U.S. embargo on Cuba, which has only hurt, not helped, the Cuban people."
"In state after state Republican legislatures are working overtime to suppress the vote and create outrageous gerrymandered districts. If Congress does not pass H.R. 1 and S. 1, millions of voters will be disenfranchised and Democrats will become a permanent minority party."
"While the very rich get richer, working class families today are facing economic devastation. Yes. We need to increase direct payment to $2000 for workers and their kids; raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour; expand the child tax credit and extend unemployment benefits."
"Trump touted bonuses he claims workers received because of his “tax reform” bill. He forgot to mention only 2% of Americans report getting a raise or a bonus because of the tax bill, or that corporations are now laying off tens of thousands of employees. #BernieResponds"
"This is what a rigged economy looks like. While 5.4 million Americans recently lost their health insurance, the top 12 billionaires in our country are now worth over $1 trillion. That is morally obscene. We need to tax the rich and expand Medicare to all."
"Taking on the greed of Wall Street, the power of gigantic multinational corporations and the influence of the global billionaire class is not only the moral thing to do – it is a strategic geopolitical imperative."
"Unless we pass the reconciliation bill:. . -Seniors won't get dental, vision, hearing & home care. . -Drug prices will soar. . -Families will be denied $300 a month per kid. . -Climate change will worsen.. . -Families won't receive childcare & affordable housing. . No reconciliation, no deal"
"In Denmark, McDonald's workers get $22 an hour, 6 weeks of paid vacation, 1 year of paid family leave, and pensions.. . In America, McDonald's workers make $9 an hour, get no benefits, and have to go on strike to get hand sanitizer during a pandemic. Enough."
There is more wealth inequality today than at any point in the last 100 years. . . It’s time billionaires pay their fair share.
"The student debt crisis is only getting worse. If we can bail out Wall Street banks after they destroyed the U.S. economy, do not tell me we cannot bail out 40 million people whose only crime is trying to get a higher education."
Washington State Dept. of Health reports that unvaccinated 65+ year-olds are 4 times more likely to get COVID compared with fully vaccinated 65+ year-olds; 9 times more likely to be hospitalized and 9 times more likely to die compared with fully vaccinated. Get vaccinated!
"If President Trump won't confront Putin about interference in our elections and his destabilizing policies, Congress must act. Tweets and speeches are fine, but we need more from Republican senators now."
"At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, the last thing we should be doing is giving more tax breaks to the very rich. Democrats campaigned and won on an agenda that demands that the very wealthy finally pay their fair share, not one that gives them more tax breaks."
"Trump should be impeached and he will be impeached. But that does not mean we neglect the other crises facing this country, whether it is the housing crisis or climate change. We are mature enough as a nation to walk and chew bubble gum at the same time."
"If you are serious about this issue, tell your Republican pals in Congress to pass bills requiring Medicare to negotiate drug prices and enabling the importation of safe, low-cost drugs from Canada and other countries. (2/2)"
"Let us be clear: In states where they have increased the minimum wage, paychecks are higher and the economy is booming. There is no excuse not to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and end starvation wages for 40 million Americans."
"If the CEOs of ExxonMobil, Chevron & BP think they can continue to put their short term profits over the future of the planet, they have another thing coming. Working together, we will take on the greed of the fossil fuel industry, combat climate change & create millions of jobs."
"People like @AdyBarkan are what this fight against the #GOPTaxScam are all about. We can defeat this horrific piece of legislation, but only if everyone stands up and fights back."
"This fine is a step in the right direction. But I want to see the corporate executives at Johnson & Johnson, Purdue, and other companies held criminally liable for their actions."
It is a sad day when two members of the Democratic Caucus are prepared to allow the Freedom to Vote Act to fail and undermine the future of American democracy. I hope very much they will reconsider their positions.
"We must build an economy that works for all Americans, not just billionaires and large corporations. Period."
"After Trump shut down the government for 35 days the first bill Sen. McConnell introduced wasn't to provide back-pay to 1.2 million federal contractors.. . It wasn't to guarantee health care or lower drug prices.. . It was to repeal the estate tax for the 1,700 wealthiest families."
"While Republican leaders want to deny $300 a week in unemployment benefits to working families, they had no problem introducing a bill this year to repeal the estate tax that would give a $1.7 trillion tax break to wealthy families who inherit over $1 billion. Total hypocrisy!"
"Trump proposed $87 billion in cuts to infrastructure over the next 10 years in his budget. How is it, Mr. President, that a nation can thrive when its infrastructure is crumbling?"
"In the richest country in the history of the world, no one should be living in poverty. It’s time to raise the current starvation level minimum wage to a living wage. It's time for Congress to pass the Raise the Wage Act to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour."
The business model of Wall Street is fraud.
"8) The founder of Medicare Rights Center says, ""Blahous concedes that Medicare for All would reduce national health spending by $2 trillion over 10 years, even after accounting for the cost of guaranteeing everyone coverage and offering better benefits."""
"Today we remember the nearly 3,000 lives lost on 9/11 and the brave people who risked their lives to help that day. Those selfless acts of sacrifice show the very best of us as a nation, and we can honor that sacrifice by working to build a world of security and dignity for all."
"While I have concerns about this bill, I supported it because I can’t turn my back on the 2 million federal employees and private contractors who would be forced again to work without pay. I am also concerned about the millions who would be denied access to government services."
"This is an outrageous move. It's entirely legitimate for democratic governments to highlight human rights issues with undemocratic governments. We must continue to do so. The US must be clear in condemning repression, especially when done by governments that receive our support."
71 percent of Americans support raising taxes on the wealthiest 2%. Tax the rich.
Do we really want to live under constant surveillance by unaccountable corporations? @SenJeffMerkley and I don't.. . We cannot allow Orwellian facial recognition technology to continue to violate the privacy and civil liberties of the American people.
"Of the many issues with Trump, his movement to an authoritarian type society here in American and his support for authoritarians around the world should be of concern to every American who believes in democracy."
The time is now for the wealthiest people and the most profitable corporations in America to pay their fair share of taxes.
Big oil companies are engaged in massive profiteering and price gouging. We need a windfall profits tax..  . March 2008. Gas: $3.23 per gallon. Oil: $104.54 per barrel.  . March 2014. Gas: $3.51. Oil: $102.28.  . Last week:. Gas: $4.10. Oil: $111.42.  . Today:. Gas: $4.32. Oil: $95.17
"With the apparent cancellation of the summit, the Trump administration should now commit itself to working with our allies in Asia and the international community on a genuine diplomatic strategy to remove the threat of North Korea’s nuclear weapons."
"Walmart’s CEO Doug McMillon made about $11,000/hour in compensation last year. I'd like to hear from him why he thinks his workers don't deserve to be paid a living wage of $15/hour."
"For centuries, America’s rise relied on treating Black people as literal property. ""Slavery By Another Name"" continued well into the 20th century. I believe we should talk about this part of our history, and learn about how it has shaped every aspect of our politics and economy."
"Climate change is destroying our ecosystems and our planet. We must take on the greed of the fossil fuel industry, and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy."
"At a time of massive wealth and income inequality, not only do we need to repeal all of the Trump tax breaks for the top 1% and large corporations, we need to tax the obscene wealth gains billionaires have made during the pandemic and expand Medicare to all."
"Remember when $15 an hour was ""radical""? Not so radical anymore thanks to people fighting for a living wage. In a historic vote today, the House of Representatives will pass legislation to end poverty wages for 33 million people."
"Fantastic news. No one in America should face discrimination for being who they are or for who they love.. . Together, we are going to defeat the hate and bigotry of this administration and stand with our LGBTQ+ family. Congratulations to everyone who fought to make this happen."
What we are debating today may seem complicated. But it is really quite simple. I’m LIVE on the floor discussing why now is the time to defend American democracy.
The president won't address our health care crisis or climate change. But he will try to divide us up and go after undocumented people who have very little political power. That is what demagogues always do and that is why he must be defeated.
"In an historic vote, the Senate sent an important message: we will no longer support Saudi Arabia in causing the worst humanitarian disaster on the planet. Congress will reassert its constitutional authority on issues of war and end U.S. support for the war in Yemen."
"85,000 children have starved to death in Yemen as a result of the Saudi-led war.. . U.S. participation in this war has not been authorized by Congress and is therefore unconstitutional.. . Tomorrow the Senate will vote to end U.S. support for this disastrous and unconstitutional war."
"A new analysis out today shows that the American Rescue Plan will dramatically reduce poverty. That’s what happens when Congress writes legislation focused on the needs of the working class, not the wealthy and huge corporations. Not complicated!"
Let me congratulate the rail unions who stood up to corporate greed and forced the industry to make important concessions. I also want to thank President Biden and Secretary Walsh for their hard work. Now it’s up to the rank-and-file union members to evaluate this deal.
"""What Trump has done is one step toward losing the hearts and minds of the Iranian people."" -@SuzanneDiMaggio #BernieTownHall"
"One year ago, a violent mob stormed the Capitol to overturn the 2020 election. That day made clear our democracy is under severe attack. We must hold responsible those who engaged in the insurrection. We must stand up to the Big Lie. We must make it easier, not harder, to vote."
Hourly Wages. Dollar General: $8. Kroger: $10. Walmart: $11. CVS: $11. Home Depot: $11. Lowe's: $12. . 2020 Profits. Dollar General: $1.4 billion. Kroger: $2 billion. Walmart: $15.6 billion. CVS: $6.2 billion. Home Depot: $10 billion. Lowe's: $4.9 billion. . U.S. workers need $15/hr and a union.
"I hope, based on last night's vote, that McConnell now changes his mind and begins to negotiate seriously. We must reopen the government as soon as possible."
"Target just raised the minimum wage for its 275,000 workers to $15 an hour. . . Now is the time for Walmart to also raise their minimum wage to at least $15 an hour.. . I suspect the world's richest family, the Walton family, can afford it."
It is outrageous that the President’s personal lawyers appear to have directed the surveillance of a U.S. ambassador.. . This must be fully investigated as the Senate conducts the impeachment trial. We have a responsibility to hold this lawless administration to account.
"Unbelievable! Not only are Republicans anti-choice but almost all of them in the House just voted against Americans, women and men, having the right to contraception. While the whole world laughs, they want to take us back to the 1800s. Ain't gonna happen."
"And we should make public colleges and universities tuition-free. This is not a ""radical"" idea. Here is how we do it:"
Every worker should have the constitutional right to join a union. Period.
"It is, quite simply, a travesty that in the year 2018 we continue to have debtors’ prisons in the United States."
"Let’s treat essential frontline workers as heroes, not just call them heroes. Cancel student debt now."
Here are all the ways Trump has failed working families:
"37 of 38 experts agreed that the Republican tax bills would cause U.S. debt to increase ""substantially"" faster than the economy. The 38th said he misread the question. #TaxDebate"
"We need to lift the burden of outrageous health care bills off the shoulders of working-class families.. . Our approach is simple, efficient, and universal:. . During this crisis, Medicare should cover all out-of-pocket health costs for everyone in America."
"Trump's sanctuary cities policy is federal coercion to enforce the president’s racist, anti-immigrant policies. This is a check on an out-of-control executive branch and a victory for the rule of law."
"I strongly support imposing penalties on countries like China, Russia, South Korea and Vietnam to stop illegal dumping of steel and aluminum. But it makes no sense to start a trade war with Canada, the EU and others who are engaged in fair trade and pay workers a living wage."
We are taking on the big-money interests who have an army of lobbyists trying to defeat Medicare for All. .  . They are terrified that the American people recognize that health care is a human right. They're right to be terrified.
"Employee-owned companies won't provide starvation wages to workers and huge compensation packages to CEOs. They will not shut down and send their own jobs to China. In fact, study after study has shown that employee ownership increases employment, sales and wages."
✅ No more premiums.. . ✅ No more co-payments.. . ✅ No more deductibles.. . ✅ No more out-of-control prescription drug prices.. . Medicare for All means significant reductions in health care costs for American families.
"Historians will look back on Dec. 1, 2017 and conclude this was one of the great robberies in US history because Republicans are looting the Treasury."
"What Dr. King understood is that the only way you make real change—whether it is racial justice, social justice or economic justice—is when millions of people come together, stand up and fight back. #MLKDay"
"Afghanistan is facing a humanitarian catastrophe. I urge the Biden administration to immediately release billions in frozen Afghan government funds to help avert this crisis, and prevent the death of millions of people."
"The Trump budget is the budget of the Koch brothers, of the billionaire class."
"Super-large yachts have become the status symbol of the billionaire class. And Russian oligarchs are not the only people who own them. While half of our people work paycheck to paycheck, members of the American oligarchy spend hundreds of millions to build their very own yachts."
"We must stand shoulder to shoulder with the Muslim community. Trump's travel ban has never been about keeping America safe—just look at the president's own word. It has always been a racist attempt to ban Muslims from entering the United States, which cannot be allowed to stand."
The president is acting out of political self-interest during a pandemic.. . I believe Congress must provide leadership instead. Here is how:
"It is not acceptable to me that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. We need an economy that works for all of us. To do that, we must increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour and give 32 million Americans a raise."
"This week I will go to the floor of the Senate to try to stop a war that has led to the deaths of many thousands of civilians, mass starvation and one of the greatest humanitarian crises in the world.. . The US Senate must vote to end our role in Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen."
"By ending the nuclear deal, has Trump put America on the path to war? Join us to discuss that question and more tonight at 7 pm ET."

"From the beginning, when Trump impulsively decided that he would meet with Kim Jong Un, it has been clear that the summit involved very little preparation. The threat of North Korea’s nuclear program is a very serious issue that requires serious diplomacy."
"Congratulations to the University of Texas for expanding access to tuition-free college! This is a step in the right direction. . . Our plan: tax Wall Street, raise $2.4 trillion, cancel student debt, and eliminate tuition at every public college and university for all students."
"If the Supreme Court wants to be on the right side of history, it must recognize that transgender people are entitled to the same civil and human rights as everybody else. Period."
"We cannot allow Donald Trump to use this horrific pandemic as an opportunity to bankrupt and privatize the Postal Service. Now, more than ever, we need a strong and vibrant postal system to deliver mail 6-days a week. Congress must act now to save it."
Wealth inequality in America is at an all-time high. It's time we make millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share.
"Health care is a human right—not a privilege, not an employee benefit. #MedicareForAll"
The United States should not be partnering in Saudi Arabia's disastrous military adventurism. The Senate can stand up this week and take an important step toward ending the brutal and unauthorized war in Yemen.
Workers have the constitutional right to form a union and negotiate for better wages. Delta’s union-busting tactics are reprehensible. My colleagues and I urge Delta's CEO to end this insulting and demeaning campaign of intimidation.
The level of destruction in Puerto Rico is unprecedented. Rebuilding will require significant resources over a long period of time.
"Today, with 6 of my colleagues, I sent a letter to Kellogg's CEO in support of the brave workers striking across the country. In a time of record profits and a terrible pandemic, let’s be clear: Kellogg can afford to treat workers with dignity."
.@RandPaull thinks having the right to health care means you believe in slavery. Here's how Canadian @DocDanielle responded to that theory:
Every week during the pandemic:. . 643 billionaires became $32 billion richer.. . The total income of the bottom 82% of workers went down by $3.7 million - combined.. . Our job: Tax the obscene wealth gains billionaires made during the pandemic and expand Medicare to all.
Look around at the big-money interests spending millions of dollars on ads to confuse the American people. How will we beat them? Through the efforts of Medicare for All champions like @RepJayapal and @NationalNurses’ Jean Ross. This is how we make health care a human right.
"We are looking at an unprecedented crisis in American history.. . The good news: Last night's bill expands unemployment benefits in a way that has never taken place before.. . We will still need to go much further, and address working people's needs in a far more substantial way."
"Trump's political strategy: . 1) Give tax breaks to billionaires, throw millions off health insurance, cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. 2) Blame immigrants (or blacks, Muslims, gays, Jews) as the cause of all problems. . This is the kind of hate politics demagogues always use"
"200 days ago, Nancy Pelosi and her House colleagues passed expanded background checks, taking common-sense action to prevent another horrific mass shooting.. . What has Mitch McConnell done? Nothing but the NRA's bidding.. . Do your damn job, Senator."
"The Trump administration has failed the people of Puerto Rico. The island is still rebuilding from Hurricane Maria, which struck the island two years ago. Now Puerto Rico is suffering blackouts after a devastating earthquake. We must do everything we can to help rebuild."
Thousands die each year because they can’t afford to get to a doctor. The situation must not get worse. We must fully fund the CHC program.
"Did you receive a $1,200 stimulus check? If not, why?. . If we provide working-class households with $2,000/month per family member during this pandemic, what would you do with it? . . What must Congress do now to protect you and your family? Share your story."
"@aylaa_renee @hacketmale @SenatorLeahy @WelchForVT We are having a ""milk toast,"" the finest beverage of the great state of Vermont."
I am proud to stand with my colleagues today to reassert our constitutional authority and introduce legislation—the No War Against Iran Act—to stop President Trump from leading this country into an illegal war against Iran.. . The American people are sick and tired of endless wars.
I would like to thank every single American who came out to fight back and save our health care. You are why we won.
#IStandWithIlhan and am proud to work with her in Congress. . . Trump is stoking the most despicable and disturbing currents in our society. And that very hatred and racism fuels him. We must fight together to defeat the most dangerous president in the history of our country.
I applaud President Biden’s important action to raise the minimum wage for federal contract workers to $15 an hour. Congress should follow his lead and end starvation wages for the rest of the nation. Let’s get it done.
"We cannot continue to have a ""debtor prison"" system in the United States. Our destructive and unjust cash bail process is part of our broken criminal justice system and it must be ended."
"The world is rapidly becoming more unhealthy and unsafe right in front of our eyes. If we don't act soon, we will see more devastating fires, more extreme weather disturbances, and massive human suffering. We can't afford to wait any longer. We need the Green New Deal now."
"If President Trump won't confront Putin about interference in our elections and his destabilizing policies, Congress must act. Tweets and speeches are fine, but we need more from Republican senators now.. . Congress must take these 5 actions to rein in Trump's dangerous behavior:"
"""Tax me!"" Let's listen to these Patriotic Millionaires who want their taxes raised, not cut."
"300 global lawmakers, @Ilhan, and I believe we need unprecedented compassion, solidarity and cooperation right now.. . To prevent major increases in poverty and hunger, the World Bank and IMF must cancel debt and provide financial support to poorer nations."
"Workers should not be intimidated, or badgered by a company because they are exercising their constitutional right to form a union."
"The Republicans say that we cannot afford to invest in health care, education, housing, nutrition and the basic needs of working families. I say that we cannot afford to give trillions in tax breaks to the rich and large corporations and spend $740 billion a year on the military."
6) @MattBruenig has found that payments to medical providers would only go down by 10.6% under Medicare for All (not 40%) which could be more than made up for by the administrative savings that would be achieved.
"President Trump said that ""nobody has been better at the military"" than him.. . So why is he keeping the government shut down and leaving 42,000 service members without paychecks for the first time in history?"
When it comes to the needs of the military industrial complex: No problem!. . When it comes to the needs of working people: Too expensive. . . I'm tired of it. We need to get our priorities right.
"Walmart is spending $20 billion on a share repurchase program.. . With a fraction of that amount, Walmart could have raised hourly wages of every employee to $15.. . Corporations should address the needs of workers before the interests of wealthy stockholders."
"If we do not get our act together on climate change, our entire planet will face irreparable harm."
"Watch this Danish conservative economist help prove my point: all people should have quality health care, higher education and child care."
The U.S. and other developed countries must develop policies to improve life for the desperately poor around the world. We should not be making a bad situation even worse.
"How the hell is it possible that 35 million people still have not gotten the one-time $1,200 they are owed? A check that was never going to be enough in the first place?. . Congress must provide $2,000 a month to all—and make it cover the past three months."
"Today the Senate voted, 55-45, to stop a war with Iran.. . The Constitution made sure Congress could vote to block a president from taking our country into needless conflicts.. . We cannot allow Trump to send working-class kids to fight and die in another endless war."
"I’m on my way to the Senate floor NOW to vote YES on the For the People Act. This is an important moment in the fight to protect our democracy, our elections, and the people's right to vote."
"A Green New Deal to defeat humanity's common enemy, climate change, is far cheaper than the cost of doing nothing."
"While the internet has been an enormous source for good, all that convenience and connection comes with a price. Our privacy has been invaded in an unprecedented way and in a manner that would have been unthinkable even 20 years ago."
"If Trump could get $287 million of his debt canceled for his bogus real estate deals, please don't tell me we can't cancel the student debt of 45 million Americans who committed the ""crime"" of getting a college education."
"There is not a ""national emergency"" with regard to the southern border. What President Trump is doing is unlawful and must be opposed vigorously in the courts and legislatively."
Young people have already demonstrated they can take on powerful fossil fuel companies and force politicians to answer their call to action. To the millions of young people and allies worldwide who are striking today to demand climate justice: I stand with you. #ClimateStrike
Anybody who thinks we do not have an oligarchy right here in America is sorely mistaken. The question before us is whether we will stand with the billionaires and big money interests or will we stand with the working families of this country and protect their interests.
"At a time when corporate profits are soaring, when major corporations are making billions a year while not paying a nickel in federal income tax, we are going to end the grotesque greed of the obscenely wealthy. We are going to demand that they pay their fair share."
"Without new funding, more than 1 million Puerto Ricans will be impacted by cuts to their food assistance. We must address this crisis immediately and bring Puerto Rico back onto SNAP. @CarmenYulinCruz"
"Congratulations to the JetBlue crew members who overwhelmingly voted to join the Transportation Workers Union. This is a significant victory for JetBlue workers, for the labor movement and for our country."
The United States cannot prosper and remain a vigorous democracy when so few have so much and so many have so little. We must address the crisis of income and wealth inequality now.
"""The message in New York City is that we’re going to respect everyone regardless of documentation status.” –@NYCMayor"
It is sick and disgraceful that pharmaceutical executives conspired to cover up their greedy price-fixing scheme when @RepCummings and I launched an investigation. They need to be investigated and held accountable by our criminal justice system.
This child psychiatrist explains the unbelievable trauma inflicted on kids separated from their parents at the border:
"TUNE IN 5pm ET TONIGHT: As you may know, the Senate passed the Inflation Reduction Act on Sunday. The vote was 51-50. I voted for it.. . There are good things and bad things about this bill. Here's what I said on the floor of the Senate.. . Tune in 5pm ET this evening to hear more."
"I believe that, maybe, just maybe, the time has come to take a ""strategic pause"" when it comes to providing tens of billions in corporate welfare to some of the most profitable corporations and wealthiest people on the planet."
"In the richest country in the history of the world, no one should have to suffer or die because they can’t afford the medicine their doctor prescribes to them."
"If Norway, along with every other major country on Earth, can make health care a right, why can't the United States do the same?"
What’s in the covid relief legislation? Here’s a quick summary.
Interesting article. Is Mr. Cooperman an evil man? No. Has he worked hard for his money? Yes. Can we create a system more rational & humane than one in which a billionaire sits at a computer screen & makes millions while people nearby go hungry? We must.
"The Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, with U.S. support, has been a humanitarian disaster. Instead of supplying bombs and refueling capabilities, we should be doing everything possible to create a peaceful resolution to that civil war and provide humanitarian help."
This tax bill is a moral and economic obscenity. It is a gift to wealthy Republican campaign contributors and an insult to the working families of our country. No member of Congress should vote for this disastrous legislation.
"If we're going to reverse the 40-year decline of the middle class and reduce the widening gap between the super-rich and everyone else, we must restore the constitutional right of workers to collectively bargain for a better life."
"If this is the wealthiest country on Earth, why are one in five American adults skipping medical care because they can't afford it?. . Answer: our health care system is built to make corporate profits — not give people the care they need. #MedicareForAll"
Today we observe #LatinaEqualPay Day because Latina women still make only 53 cents on the dollar compared to white men. It should not be a radical idea to address that issue of basic equality.
"Amy Coney Barrett's nomination is not legitimate. It's less than 2 weeks from election day, but the election is already happening now. Over 40 million have already cast their ballots. . . It's dangerous, anti-democratic, and illegitimate to confirm a Supreme Court justice now."
"Hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. have not been convicted of a crime but are incarcerated because they cannot afford bail. Today, we are introducing legislation to end that disgrace."
The trauma and tragedy of George Floyd’s murder must never leave us. It was a manifestation of a system that callously devalues the lives of Black people.
"Trump calls Egypt's Sisi his 'favorite dictator.'. . I believe the United States should stand for human rights, especially with governments that receive large amounts of US aid, as Egypt does. All people have the right to protest for a better future. Sisi should respect that right."
"LIVE: Watch Sen. Sanders speak at @SAISHopkins on about the problem of authoritarian nationalism threatening democratic societies, and the need to build a global progressive movement."
"The January 6th hearings remind us that politics today is not a debate over ideas. It's about whether we maintain our democratic form of government against those who propagate a Big Lie, violence and authoritarianism."
The killing of Palestinian demonstrators by Israeli forces in Gaza is tragic. It is the right of all people to protest for a better future without a violent response.
"The climate crisis means more frequent and more intense heatwaves around the world. Our job must be to rapidly transform our energy system from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. With a Green New Deal, we can save the planet and create millions of new jobs."
"We must also reflect on the 18-year-old ""war on terror"" and the harm it has caused. If we do not move decisively to end America’s longest war, we will soon see servicemembers fight and die in Afghanistan and around the world in a conflict that was started before they were born."
"At this time of unprecedented crisis, we must move forward to boldly address the systemic and existential threats facing us today and that includes combating climate change and making sure that every American has a safe and decent place to live."
"If we are bold, if we have the courage to take on the fossil fuel industry, if we are prepared to invest in sustainable energy, we can make the necessary changes to save the planet. And that’s exactly what we have to do. #RiseForClimate"
"One theory is that by spending $740,000,000,000 on the most sophisticated weapons of mass destruction in world history, we'll be safer.. . I'm not so sure.. . Maybe what makes us safer is breaking down fear and hatred around the world, so that we can recognize our common humanity."
"Democracy means one person, one vote. It does not mean outrageous gerrymandering maps and absurd laws to suppress to vote."
"It is time for Congress to investigate the opioid crisis, to learn what the drug companies knew about these products and to hold them accountable."
"The Republican budget contains cuts that will kill people, cuts that will hurt people, cuts that should not be allowed in a humane society."
We cannot risk a Supreme Court that would put in jeopardy a woman's right to control her own body.. . Our job: mobilize Americans to demand the Senate must not vote on any potential Supreme Court justice until people have had a chance to make their voices heard in November.
The corporate lobbyists working on this bill are like pigs at the trough.
"A cancer patient should be able to focus all their time and energy on their road to recovery. Instead, this single mom had to worry about $160,000 in medical bills. We need #MedicareForAll."
"During the 1930s, as part of FDR's New Deal we electrified the nation. In the 1960s, we sent a man to the moon as part of JFK's space program. Today, we must combat climate change and lead the world away from fossil fuels. We cannot fail. The future of the planet is at stake."
"Trump's former chief economic advisor Gary Cohn seems to have a bit of amnesia. He recently asked the question, ""What laws were broken?"" when asked about the big banks who crashed our economy in 2008. Let's refresh his memory:"
We know our health care system is profoundly broken when a family has to file for bankrupcy for saving their newborn's life.
Corporations tell workers that forming a union will hurt business. Yet somehow they can still afford hundreds of millions of dollars on expensive union-busting firms..  . We are going to end the corporate assault on workers standing up for their rights.
"LIVE: I’m on the floor of the U.S. Senate to discuss the so-called “Inflation Reduction Act"" and I want to put the bill into the context of where we are as a nation."
"No more private prisons and private detention centers. No more profiteering from locking people up. No more ""war on drugs."" No more keeping people in jail because they're too poor to afford cash bail. Instead of more jails and incarceration, we need more jobs and education."
STARTING SOON: Watch our national town hall on addressing the international crisis of climate change. Tune in at 7 PM ET:
"To truly honor Dr. King we must fight to carry out his radical and bold vision for racial and economic justice in America and transform our national priorities. The struggle continues to this day, and our work is far from over. #MLKDay"
What happened in Las Vegas is a tragedy. But it's one we continue to repeat. We need commonsense legislation to save innocent people.
"Meanwhile, one out of five Americans cannot afford the prescriptions their doctors write, and thousands die each year because they lack the money to buy the medicine they need."
"When I voted against the Gulf War in 1991, I thought I'd have a very short political career.. . Today, I am proud to help lead bipartisan efforts in Congress to stop endless war.. . Our job is to bring progressives and conservatives together to defeat the military industrial complex."
Democrats in Congress secured life-saving unemployment aid to workers so they wouldn’t have to go back to work for starvation wages or without childcare. I sent a letter to Labor Secretary Walsh today asking him to ensure Republican Governors do not strip that assistance away.
"Justice for frontline workers means childcare, safe conditions and $500 a week in hazard pay to:. . 🛒Grocery workers. 👷🏼‍♀️Transit workers and truck drivers. 📦Warehouse, delivery and postal workers. 👩🏽‍⚕️Paramedics, nurses, pharmacy employees. 🧺Domestic workers. 👨🏼‍🌾Farm laborers. 🧼Janitors"
"If we were a poor country, it would be reasonable to question whether we can achieve universal health care.. . But we are not. We're the richest country in the history of the world. We can and must make health care a right to all."
"Last week, the House passed the No War Against Iran Act that I introduced with @RepRoKhanna.. . Senate Republicans now have a choice: Will they pass my bill and stand up for the Constitution? Or will they allow Trump to illegally lead us into a disastrous war in the Middle East?"
My statement on President Biden’s student debt announcement.
Imagine proposing a plan that you know will kill thousands of Americans every year.. . That's exactly what Donald Trump's EPA just did.
Private prison companies invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. Now they are getting their reward with Trump's inhumane immigration policies and corporate tax cuts.
"Thank you air traffic controllers, flight attendants, federal workers and contract employees for standing up for your rights, holding rallies, organizing and sharing heartbreaking stories over the past 35 days. You are the reason that the government shutdown finally ended."
Why are Republicans bringing forth such an absurd budget that is diametrically opposed to what the American people want? Follow the money.
Trump's attack on the DACA program is the ugliest and most cruel decision made by a president in our modern history.. . I will do everything I possibly can to protect Dreamers from being thrown out of the only country they have ever known.
"This Covid relief bill is a step forward. The average family of four will receive $2400 under this bill.. . Will that help? Yes, it will. Is it enough? No, it is not. Under the Biden administration, we will continue to work hard and see our people through this crisis."
"The average interest rate for a payday loan in Utah? 652%. 70-year-old Vietnam veterans are being jailed for not being able to keep up.. . The Loan Shark Prevention Act, from @AOC and I, would put an end this disgusting greed."
There can be no free society without a free media. The work of journalists in this country is absolutely essential to our communities and to a free and functioning democracy. Journalists should never have to fear for their lives as they do their work.
"When 1 in 4 Americans can’t afford their prescription drugs, maybe, just maybe, we should take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry."
I applaud Democrats in the House of Representatives for uniting to pass the Build Back Better Act. The Senate has an opportunity to make this a truly historic piece of legislation. We will listen to the demands of the American people and strengthen the bill.
What does our system of inequality mean to you and your family? #InequalityTownHall
"At a time of massive income inequality, at a time when we face the existential threat of climate change, at a time when millions of families are struggling, now is the time to study the so-called “Inflation Reduction Act” and come up with amendments as to how we can improve it."
Eid Mubarak to all of our Muslim friends around the world.
"The Green New Deal for Public Housing is a win-win-win: we will invest in our public housing, address the climate emergency, and create more than 240,000 good-paying jobs."
119. That’s how many days of paid leave new moms are guaranteed in Canada.. . Do you know how many days of paid leave they’re guaranteed in the United States? Z-E-R-O. What a disgrace.
"Vermont middle and high school students: I want to hear from you! Join me this Wednesday, February 16 for a virtual town meeting to discuss the issues that matter most to you. To participate in the discussion, register at the link below."
Billionaires are waging class war against the working people of this country in the middle of a pandemic. That is obscene. It’s time to stand up and fight back.
"I hope my Republican colleagues who believe that women, not the government, have the right to control their own bodies will stand with the overwhelming majority of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, who don't want Roe v. Wade overturned."
"We cannot live in an economy where we do what is only good for the employer. It’s about time that we start looking at the needs of workers, and not just large corporations."
"The fact that the company was able to force workers to attend closed door, anti-union meetings is just one reason as to why we need legislation that finally gives workers a fair chance to win organizing elections."
"CHCs provide affordable, high-quality health care to more than 27 million people including primary care, dentistry and low-cost Rx drugs."
"We must make it easier, not harder, for all workers to form a union. That includes Congressional Staff. I stand in solidarity with Congressional staff working to form a union."
"Trump's top economic advisor just dismissed a devastating climate change report from the United Nations. What Trump, his administration and his fossil fuel executive friends are doing to the planet is criminal."
"A majority of our seniors get most of their income from Social Security—less than $1,500 a month, on average.. . Washington lobbyists can spend that in one night on a fancy dinner!. . Tell me why we can give billionaires tax breaks but can't afford to expand Social Security."
"Join me live on Twitter and Facebook in a few moments, as I lay out my strong opposition to the Trump Administration's attempts to put us on the brink of a catastrophic and unconstitutional war with Iran."
"Jeff Bezos, the wealthiest man alive, became $83 billion richer over the past 9 months while Amazon made record profits. Meanwhile, Amazon workers are risking their lives to fill holiday orders and are denied paid sick leave and hazard pay. This ugly corporate greed must end."
Tonight at 7 PM ET we will present a live town hall event on the rise of the oligarchy and the collapse of the American middle class. Watch here:
"What we are witnessing is the absolute absurdity of our profit-driven, employer-based, private health care system.. . Health care can no longer be an employee benefit—we must make it a human right, through Medicare for All."
"If any Senator believes this is the last time they will cast a vote on whether or not to give a raise to 32 million Americans, they are sorely mistaken. We’re going to keep bringing it up, and we’re going to get it done because it is what the American people demand and need."
"We should listen to what Sen. McConnell said in 2016. President Trump should not nominate, and the Senate should not confirm, a Supreme Court justice until the American people have had the opportunity to make their voices heard in November."
"Millions of Americans are still waiting on their unemployment benefits.. . But if you're Trump's friend and own a huge coal company, don't worry—the government's here to help.. . This obscene system of socialism for the rich has got to end."
"If Congress does not get its act together, we're going to have 800,000 bright young people with no legal status who will be subject to deportation and thrown out of the only country they have ever known. We must protect the DREAMers and move them towards citizenship."
3) We should reinstate the ban on assault weapons in this country—weapons which are designed for no other purpose but to kill human beings.
"Trump and his allies are stoking anti-Chinese bigotry in response to the coronavirus pandemic.. . We cannot tolerate this kind of racism—especially at this moment.. . This crisis requires our political leadership to unite our country, not divide us up."
"The Pentagon is set to grow by $90 billion and reach $738 billion next year. For $90 billion, we could double nutrition assistance or provide $7,000 to every child in poverty. . . We cannot keep handing over billions to the military-industrial complex."
It's time politicians got out of the pocket of the fossil fuel industry and started listening to 72% of America—including the majority of Republicans.. . The American people agree: we need to act now to fight climate change.
"At a time when 44 million Americans have $1.5 trillion in student debt, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos has invested millions in companies that take advantage of kids trying to get a higher education."
Congratulations to Ryan Cochran-Siegle of Vermont for winning silver in the super-G for the USA at the Beijing Olympics! Your perseverance is an inspiration to people across Vermont and the nation.
"Trump tweeted this morning he did a ""great job"" handling the hurricane crisis in Puerto Rico. Meanwhile, new estimates put the Hurricane Maria death toll at nearly 3,000. What a disgrace."
"American companies have to worry about paying thousands of dollars a year on health insurance for each employee..  . Medicare for All covers everyone. That means more people can start new businesses, manufacturing can be more competitive, and companies can invest in their workers."
This incompetent administration’s response to the coronavirus has threatened the lives and health of many people.. . Congress must immediately ensure that everyone who needs coronavirus testing and treatment gets it without ever having to open their wallet.
"No, Mr. President. You're not ""pro-life"" when you attempt to throw 23 million Americans off their health insurance and eliminate protections for pre-existing conditions. You're not ""pro-life"" when 68,000 Americans die each year because they can't afford to go to a doctor on time."
"Meanwhile, the situation in Gaza remains a humanitarian disaster. The U.S. must play a more positive role in ending the Gaza blockade and helping Palestinians and Israelis build a future that works for all."
99% of applications for loan forgiveness in this program are being rejected. The Department of Education is failing our public service workers and students..  . Our job:. - Stand up to Betsy DeVos and the predatory lenders. - Cancel student debt and make public colleges tuition-free
"Today we remember the nearly 3,000 lives lost on 9/11 and many brave people who risked their lives that day to help. Those acts of selfless sacrifice speak to the very best of us as a nation—we are a people prepared to come together and work for the good of our fellow Americans."
"As a child, @RepJimmyGomez grew up without health insurance. Today he is calling for Medicare for All to guarantee health care to every person, so that no one has to go through what his family did."
"We need to understand that the struggle for democracy is bound up with the struggle against kleptocracy and corruption, both here in the United States as well as abroad. #SandersSAIS"
"The repeal of #NetNeutrality hands the internet over to a handful of corporations while people of color, low-income families, disabled communities and rural towns get pushed offline. with @mediajustice"
It is unacceptable that our nation’s public housing is in a state of chronic disrepair and energy inefficiency after generations of government neglect.
"President Biden is absolutely right. Senate Democrats must end the filibuster and codify the right to an abortion NOW. If you allow the broken rules of the Senate to stand in the way of guaranteeing basic rights for our people, you don’t really stand for those rights."
"Jane and I want to take this opportunity to wish everyone a very Happy Thanksgiving. In these difficult times let us continue standing together, with hope and love, to create the world of peace and justice that we all deserve. Despair is not an option."
"It may be news to @LindseyGrahamSC, but Amazon has a 150% percent turnover rate. Workers come into the warehouses, they are worked as hard as humanly possible, and they leave, often crushed. Is this really a business model that should be rewarded with federal contracts?"
Nobody said it would be easy to take on the drug and insurance companies and special interests who make billions from our dysfunctional health care system. . . But we will win this struggle for Medicare for All because the American people understand that health care is a right.
Why is the price of oil LOWER today than it was in 2014 while the average price for a gallon of gas nationwide is 80 cents a gallon HIGHER than it was eight years ago? Answer: Corporate greed. Now is no time for profiteering. Now is the time for a windfall profits tax.
"The United States must speak out strongly against the violence by government-allied Israeli extremists in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, and make clear that the evictions of Palestinian families must not go forward."
"While the price of a bag of Snickers has more than doubled, Republicans want to give the Mars family, who became 44% richer during the pandemic and are now worth $106 billion, a tax break of up to $42 billion by repealing the estate tax. Yes. Trickle down economics is very scary."
"Jet flyovers and corporate TV ads ain't gonna cut it. If we truly want to honor our frontline workers, we must guarantee to them:. . 🛌Universal paid sick leave. 👷🏻‍Safe workplaces. 🥽Protective gear. 💪$15 minimum wage. ✊🏾Right to a union. 🍼Child care. ⚠️Hazard pay. 🏥Health care"
"During this horrific pandemic, which has taken over 800,000 American lives, corporate profits are soaring, and the billionaire class has become much wealthier. In fact, income and wealth inequality today is higher than at any time in the last 100 years."
"LIVE NOW: Join a discussion on criminal justice reform live from Philadelphia with Sen. Sanders, Larry Krasner, Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, Premal Dharia and Daniel Denvir."
Minimum weeks of paid medical leave for workers:. . 🇲🇽 52. 🇮🇪 52. 🇹🇷 52. 🇩🇪 52. 🇪🇸 52. 🇯🇵 52. 🇬🇧 52. 🇦🇺 52. 🇵🇹 52. 🇱🇺 52. 🇨🇿 52. 🇧🇪 52. 🇳🇴 52. 🇫🇷 52. 🇸🇮 52. 🇺🇸 0. . We must join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee paid sick leave to every single worker in America.
"Wall Street and corporate CEOs are ""deeply concerned"" about the U.S. defaulting on our national debt. Yet, they keep providing campaign funds for Republicans, the party which refuses to pay the bill on the spending incurred during the Trump years. Total hypocrisy."
"12 million people in Yemen are suffering from severe hunger and 85,000 kids have already died from starvation as a result of the Saudi-led war.. . The United States should not be supporting Saudi Arabia in this disastrous war. The U.S. Senate must vote to end our involvement."
"The American people do not want a president who is trying to divide us up based on the color of our skin, our nation of origin, our religion, our gender, or our sexual orientation. #BernieResponds"
"@GOPSenFinance @SenatorEnzi @BudgetGOP ""Hats off"" to Senate Republicans for advancing their tax scam. #KillTheBill"
"Unlike Trump, Congress must take real action to lower the price of prescription drugs. That means passing legislation requiring Medicare to negotiate for lower drug prices and allowing the reimportation of safe, low-cost prescription drugs from Canada and other countries."
Maybe Trump and Republican leaders believe a government shutdown would be a welcome distraction from the ongoing Russia investigation. But a shutdown would harm working-class families who would be unable to access vital services.
"No, Mr. Bezos. Disinformation is Amazon spreading anti-union propaganda & forcing workers to attend illegal captive audience meetings. Disinformation is Amazon blaming a 17% price increase on ""inflation"" while making a record $35 billion in profits & avoiding $5 billion in taxes."
I have consistently voted against the unconstitutional surveillance of Americans under the Patriot Act.. . Today's bill does not do nearly enough to rein in out-of-control spying powers.. . I stand with my Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle who demand stronger reforms.
"There are millions of seniors who cannot afford dental care, hearing aids or eyeglasses. In the richest country on earth that is unacceptable. That is why Medicare must negotiate drug prices and use the savings to expand Medicare to cover these basic health care needs."
"""There are people who welcome a breakdown of this agreement and welcome getting back the possibility of regime change."" –@LaraFriedmanDC #BernieTownHall"
"The reality is that Disney’s greed, and the greed of corporate America, is destroying the social fabric of our country. This type of ruthless capitalism is not an economic model that we should be embracing. We can and we must do better."
"Minimum weeks of paid sick leave in Germany, France, Mexico and Japan: 52. . United States: 0. . I have been fighting for three decades to change that.. . Maybe this global pandemic will revise our thinking a little bit."
"""The only way that I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel."" –Jeff Bezos, worth $147 billion. . Mr. Bezos, here's another idea. Pay your workers enough so that thousands of them no longer have to rely on food stamps."
"""Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts. Have to do it."" . –Donald Trump, June 16, 2015"
"I agree with Harvard Business School professor Marco Di Maggio. Lifting the burden of student loans allows people to make better decisions, feel more freedom to make changes in their careers, and spend more money, which goes back into the economy."
Democratic and Republican senators must continue efforts to produce a bi-partisan Dream Act that can be voted upon by the Senate as part of the overall budget deal.
"Over the last few weeks, I have worked very hard to provide direct payments to working families across America.. . While we did not get as much as we wanted, the average family of four will receive a direct payment of $2400.. . In this horrific crisis, we must fight for more relief."
"It is a disgrace that at a time when authoritarianism, conspiracy theories and political violence are on the rise not a single Republican in the United States Senate has the courage to even debate whether we should protect American democracy or not."
"Thank you, Koch brothers, for accidentally making the case for Medicare for All!"
This is not a real conference committee. It is a sham. This tax legislation has already been written behind closed doors.
"Real American power is not shown by our ability to blow things up, but by our ability to forge international consensus around shared problems. That is what the Iran agreement did.. . Today President Trump put us on a very different, more dangerous path."
"The mainstream media has it wrong. Delaying the infrastructure vote won't be a ""setback"" for Biden. It will be a major step towards passing the most transformative piece of legislation since the New Deal. There can be no infrastructure bill without a strong reconciliation bill."
"Unbelievable but true: The same Republicans who voted for trillions in tax breaks for the top 1% and large corporations, now want to increase taxes on working families through user fees, more toll roads and higher gas taxes while cutting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid."
"While Jeff Bezos spends $12 million renovating his 5th mansion, this Amazon employee is forced to live out of her car."
Fox News is at it again. They can't accept what a right-wing think tank found: that Medicare for All will actually save our country trillions of dollars.
Millions of Americans are at risk of losing health care because Congress did not renew funding for the community health center program.
"Real change never takes place from the top on down. It takes place from the bottom on up, when people stand up and fight for justice."
"My Republican colleagues love to say the U.S. has the best health care in the world. Well, these Canadians think otherwise and so do I."
"Mitch McConnell and the Republican Party don't believe we have to address climate change, the major crisis facing this planet. That is a disgrace. . . We need a Green New Deal that says we are going to boldly confront climate change and create millions of jobs in the process."
"The Republican agenda is clear.. . Our plan: make health care a right to all. Stop giving tax breaks to billionaires. Protect and expand Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Transition to sustainable energy and leave behind a livable planet for our children."
Gov. Northam should resign. Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax should step in and begin a new day for Virginia.
"Today is historic! The powerful House @WaysMeansCmte is holding a hearing on universal health care —a major step toward passing #MedicareforAll.. . Watch @RepJayapal and @RepDebDingell explain what this hearing means, and how we advance the fight for health care as a human right."
See my full statement here:
"If a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist. No single financial institution should be so large that its failure would cause catastrophic risk to millions of Americans, to our nation’s economic well-being, and to the global economy."
Making Gaza's beaches safe for swimming is a small but important step in addressing Gaza's environmental and humanitarian crisis. We must continue to bring people together for these efforts in Palestine and across the region.
Wealth inequality is a profound moral and economic issue this country must address. . . The richest two Americans cannot continue owning more wealth than the bottom 40% of our country while millions cannot afford the basics to live.
"I'm not sure why President Trump wants to shut down the government over an $18 billion wall that no one wants, isn't needed and Mexico won't pay for. What the American people want, overwhelmingly, is to provide legal protection and a path toward citizenship for 800,000 Dreamers."
Medicare for All means:. . ✅ No copays. ✅ No deductibles. ✅ Freedom of choice in doctors and hospitals. ✅ Coverage for every American. . The function of our current system is to make billions of dollars for the insurance and drug companies. That is what instability looks like.
"Poverty is, in my view, a death sentence. The poorest older Americans die at twice the rate as the richest. . . We must end our country’s obscene inequality and ensure basic economic security for all—or we will condemn an entire generation to early death."
"It's no accident that 71% of Americans have a favorable view of unions the highest since 1965, while just 36% hold a favorable view of corporations the lowest since Wall Street crashed the economy in 2008. The American people are sick and tired of corporate greed."
Corporate greed is Amazon blaming a 17% increase in its prime membership fees on labor costs while its profits soared 56% last year to $33 billion & Jeff Bezos became $74 billion richer during the pandemic. The problem is not the Amazon worker making $15 an hour. It's greed.
Here’s what happens to cities devastated by hurricanes after the cameras leave:
We are starting to see the beginning of a political revolution. Candidates from coast to coast are standing tall for a progressive agenda that works for the working families of our country and not just the billionaire class. #BernieResponds
"We need to change national priorities in this country. Instead of giving a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the top 1 percent and large, profitable corporations, we need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour."
TODAY working families will start receiving direct monthly payments of up to $300 per child as part of the historic expansion of the Child Tax Credit. It is a huge step towards cutting childhood poverty in half and will bring relief to parents and caregivers across the country.
Let us never forget that at the time of his death Martin Luther King was organizing a multi-racial Poor People's Campaign and that he was assassinated in Memphis as he supported sanitation workers who were on strike for better wages and working conditions.
"After taking government handouts like $880 million in tax breaks in 2018, Walmart is now cutting jobs.. . Here's a ""radical"" idea: The richest corporations in America laying off workers and paying them starvation wages need to get off corporate welfare."
"He promised to stand up to the power of corporate interests, but supported the FCC decision to end net neutrality, something Comcast, AT&T and other media conglomerates were begging for."
I strongly disagree with tonight’s decision by the Senate Parliamentarian. But the fight to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour continues.
It does not take great moral courage to pass an issue that nearly 9 in 10 Americans agree on – to allow DACA recipients to stay in the only country they have ever known and have a pathway to citizenship. And yet Republicans will not allow that to happen.
This takeaway from the Mark Zuckerberg hearing gets to the heart of the issue: how do we use Facebook and the internet without seeing an invasion of our personal privacy?
"By voting for this budget, Senate Republicans are voting to slash Medicare and Medicaid. We cannot allow this to pass."
"When I think about the gathering of billionaires at Davos at a time of obscene income and wealth inequality I recall what Dr. King said: “God never intended for one group of people to live in superfluous inordinate wealth, while others live in abject deadening poverty.”"
"Amal Hussain died recently in Yemen. She was 7 years old. . . She is one of 85,000 children who have starved to death as a result of the catastrophic Saudi-led war in Yemen. . . The Senate has an opportunity today to end U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's destructive foreign policy."
"It is astounding that we have a president who celebrates 13 million people losing their health insurance. Instead of bragging about more Americans without health care, we should be joining the rest of the industrialized world and guaranteeing health care to all people as a right."
The Senate is voting on whether to move forward with my resolution to end U.S. support for the horrific Saudi-led war in Yemen. Watch here:
"At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, the working class of this country is fighting back. Congratulations to the workers at Starbucks, Amazon and MIT for their successful union organizing efforts over the last week. Let's keep going forward together."
"Happy Town Meeting Day, Vermont. While our tradition looks different this year, Vermont remains an example to the rest of the nation. If we want a strong democracy, we must make voting easier – not harder."
"To support the American people during this pandemic, Congress must:. . 💵 Guarantee 100% of all workers' paychecks. 💊 Empower Medicare to pay all out-of-pocket costs. 🏦 Provide $2,000 a month for all. 🤒 Give paid sick leave to all workers. 🏡 Suspend rent and mortgage payments"
"The three wealthiest people in America own more wealth than the bottom 50 percent — over 160 million people. Meanwhile, almost half of families in America can't afford basic necessities. Is that really the kind of society we want to be living in?"
"Last week, 6.6 million applied for unemployment. Millions more will lose their jobs in the coming weeks. In the midst of this horrific crisis, Congress must pass a new, unprecedented emergency bill that guarantees income and health care for all Americans. Working on details now."
"More than 17 misconduct complaints were filed against Officer Chauvin, but he stayed on the force for years.. . That is outrageous. George Floyd would still be alive if we had real police accountability.. . We need a massive overhaul of policing in America."
"Warren Buffett was right. There is class warfare in America and his side is winning. While 40 million Americans face eviction, 10 billionaires increased their wealth by $368 billion since March. We need to tax the rich and create an economy that works for all of us, not the 1%."
"We are the only wealthy country where millions are losing their jobs and health care at precisely the moment when they need them the most.. . @MarkWarner, @SenDougJones, @SenBlumenthal and I have a plan to restore the wages and benefits of every rank-and-file worker in America:"
"Thirty million don't have enough to eat, 22 million are behind on rent.. . It is morally obscene that the American people have to rely on GoFundMe to pay for rent and food.. . Mitch McConnell: End your vacation. Pass emergency relief now."
Volunteer firefighters and EMTs play an enormously important role in rural America. But many departments are struggling right now to retain staff and attract new recruits. We talked to some Vermonters about how we can begin to address the crisis.
"Once again, the Trump administration sides with big money and against democracy. If this passes, the internet and its free exchange of information as we have come to know it will cease to exist. #NetNeutrality"
"Here's a radical idea: Workers should be able to organize unions to fight for better pay and conditions without fear of intimidation, threats and often illegal behavior from their employers."
"If Trump shuts the federal government down, should federal employees be available to escort him to his beachfront resort in Florida for a 16-day holiday? I don’t think so!"
"The president must respect the will of the majority of the Senate, which voted today to block weapons from being transferred to the brutal Saudi dictatorship. The Saudis are using U.S.-made bombs to kill people in Yemen and creating a horrific humanitarian disaster."
"During this emergency, the government should cover all of the health care you need—that means no out-of-pocket expenses."
"President Trump. Do not shut down the government again. Another Trump shutdown would be not only harmful to our federal workers, but also to the safety and security of our nation."
These millionaires want President Trump to know there is nothing patriotic about shifting the tax burden onto the middle class.
"The U.S. Senate is the only institution in the world where a vote of 59-41 can be considered a defeat instead of a huge victory. Enough is enough. Let us change the outdated rules of the Senate, end the filibuster and pass a bold agenda for working families with majority vote."
What does it mean when the function of the health care system—in the richest country in the history of the world—is to make billions for insurance and drug companies? . . 18 percent of Americans with diabetes are rationing the medications they need to live.
"Our health care system isn't designed to provide quality, cost-effective care for all. It exists to make profits for insurance companies, drug companies and medical equipment suppliers. That must change. #MedicareForAll"
The loudest voices in the Republican Party demanding that women be forced to give birth against their will are exactly the same people who oppose virtually every effort here in Congress designed to improve life for children and their mothers.
"It would be unspeakable and a moral stain on our nation if we turned our backs on the 800,000 young Dreamers who were born and raised in this country and who know no other home but the United States. #BernieResponds"
"We've lost 900,000 jobs in two decades thanks to NAFTA. The status quo must change."
We need to seriously address the issue of immigration but that does not mean dividing families and reducing legal immigration by 25-50 percent. #BernieResponds
"$106 billion in profits. $0 in taxes. That's 91 of America's richest corporations.. . By taking on the very wealthy, the billionaire class, and large multinational corporations, we will raise the funds to provide the services that will give dignity to working families in America."
"No matter what Fox News comes up with to try to discredit Medicare for all, a majority of the American people have made it clear time and time again that we should join every other major country and make health care a right."
"Instead of an austerity program for working families and the poor, we need austerity for billionaires and large multinational corporations."
"I’m LIVE on the floor of the Senate to make clear that now is the time for MAJOR legislation that meets the needs of our people. Right now, the Inflation Reduction Act falls short of that goal."
"All Americans have a right to breathe clean air and drink clean water. Yet Andrew Wheeler, Trump's nominee to lead the EPA, won't commit to regulating a family of toxic chemicals found in our drinking water."
"I would hope that because of the leadership of these young people, we can stop the slaughter of children in our schools. I applaud these kids immensely for standing up and speaking out."
"There it is. Paul Ryan just admitted that after providing $1 trillion in tax breaks to the top 1% and large corporations, Republicans will try to cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and help for the most vulnerable Americans."
The question before Congress right now is pretty simple: Do we fulfil what democracy is supposed to be about and stand up for working families or do we bow down to powerful special interests?
"In Denmark, as a result of strong unions, McDonald's workers make $22 an hour, get 6 weeks paid vacation & 1 year of paid leave.. . In the US, 58% of McDonald's workers make less than $12 an hour & no benefits while its CEO makes $20 million. Every worker needs a union. #MayDay2022"
"The fact that Wall Street executives made an obscene $3 billion profit off of the death and destruction of California's raging wildfires shows you just how absurd and cruel casino capitalism has become. We need an economy that works for all, not the 1%."
"The rapid rise of oligarchy and wealth and income inequality is the great moral, economic, and political issue of our time. Join us at 7 PM ET tonight on Facebook Live for conversation about inequality in America."
"Obamacare made it illegal for insurance companies to refuse coverage to the more than 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. If Trump gets his way, that protection will be repealed."
People all over this country are working longer and longer hours for lower wages. It’s time for change. It’s time for government to finally address the long-neglected needs of the working class.
"ABC, CBS, and NBC mentioned climate change in less than 4% of their coverage of the California wildfires.. . On Monday night, I'm hosting a town hall on climate change so that we can have a serious discussion on this issue. I hope you'll join us:"
"If Rob Walton, a key owner of Walmart, can afford an estimated $226 million for an antique car collection that includes 12 Ferraris, 6 Porsches, 2 Maseratis and a 1963 Corvette Grand Sport Roadster, you know what? Walmart can afford to pay at least $15/hour to all of its workers."
"It is disgraceful that we have a president who is holding hostage the paychecks of 800,000 federal employees all because he didn't like being attacked by Fox News. Mr. President, end this dangerous shutdown now."
Republicans have to change the name of their tax bill because it violates Senate rules. What should we call it now?
"This legislation is an important step toward reasserting that constitutional power, and I hope it will lead to a larger discussion, both in the Congress and among the public, about the uses of military force in our foreign policy."
"Let us guarantee health care as a right for every man, woman and child in this country."
"Community health centers are at the frontlines of this pandemic, providing health care to nearly 30 million low-income people.. . More than 160 lawmakers and I are demanding billions in additional funding so these centers have all the supplies, staff, and equipment they need."
“Which side are you on?” It is a simple yet profound political question. Is the Democratic Party prepared to stand on the side of struggling working families?
"If you are concerned about education, infrastructure and health care, then you should be concerned about foreign policy. #BernieTownHall"
"TOMORROW: Join me at 5pm ET for a livestreamed Q&A discussion with the White House’s COVID-19 Response Coordinator @AshishKJha46. We will discuss what's going on now with the pandemic, what the future may hold, and the best ways to stay safe and healthy."
The Postmaster General needs to resign or be removed from office now. We need a Postmaster General who will work overtime to ensure the prompt delivery of mail—not a top Trump campaign contributor who is undermining the Postal Service and slowing down the mail.. . DeJoy must go.
"Today President Trump, in a rambling and dishonest statement, tried to defend the despotic Saudi regime and cast doubt on the CIA’s conclusion that the crown prince was personally involved in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi."
In 2004 Judge Kavanaugh testified the nomination of William Pryor to the 11th Circuit “was not one that I worked on personally.” Documents now contradict that statement. (4/x)
"Many Americans are unaware that the people of Yemen are suffering today in a devastating civil war, or that U.S. forces have been actively engaged in support of the Saudi coalition in this war."
"This is how our rigged system works:. . 1) Republicans give huge tax breaks to their wealthy campaign contributors. . 2) Billionaires spend millions to elect Republicans. . 3) Republicans push cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid to make the rich richer and everyone else poorer"
This is what a rigged and corrupt system looks like..  . Effective Tax Rate:. 0.1%: Warren Buffett worth $111 billion. 1.1%: Jeff Bezos worth $131 billion. 1.8% Mike Bloomberg worth $82 billion. 2.1%: Elon Musk worth $210 billion. 13.5%: Registered Nurse.  . Yes. It's time to #TaxTheRich
"How insane is this? We tell young people to get the best education they can, and then saddle them for decades with crushing loan debt.. . It is not a ""radical idea"" to tax Wall Street, make public colleges and universities tuition-free, and cancel $1.7 trillion in student debt."
How do we reenergize the American people to stand up and take on the 1% who is prepared to step on everyone in their way?#InequalityTownHall
"Over 60 grassroots organizations representing millions of people are demanding Congress provide $1,200 direct payments to working-class adults and $500 to kids.. . It is time for Congress to listen to the will of the people and pass relief for working families."
President Trump believes we should listen to fossil fuel executives and ignore climate change. . . I believe we should listen to the scientists who tell us we must aggressively combat climate change and transform our energy system to sustainable energy.
Let me give you two reasons why Congress must reassert its constitutional authority over war: the war in Iraq and the war in Vietnam. In both wars Congress sat back and failed to ask the hard questions as two administrations led us into conflicts with disastrous consequences.
"Is anyone in the United States Congress willing to tell me with a straight face that “yeah, the American people enjoy paying some of the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?” Totally absurd."
"Corporations have dumped toxic ""forever chemicals"" into our environment. It's now in 43 cities' water supplies.. . My bill forces these companies to pay for the cleanup.. . Maybe I'm ""radical,"" but I think the water in our taps must be free of toxic chemicals."
"Trump says the economy is ""booming."" It is—for the top 10 CEOs who saw their combined compensation soar by 60% in 2017. . . For the average worker, however, real wages went up by just 1.2% over the past year. . . The very rich get richer. Working families continue to struggle."
"What a hypocrite: While Trump demonizes immigrants, his New York country club exploits undocumented workers and steals their wages. Together, we will build an economy that treats all workers with dignity."
"As millions of workers struggle without sick pay and as seniors deal with unaffordable medical bills, President Trump is working overtime to protect the real victims of the coronavirus: fossil fuel executives."
"In 2016, the chairman of Mylan received a $164 million compensation package after his company jacked-up the price of an EpiPen by 550% over a nine-year period..  . Let me repeat: it’s time to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry."
"The people of Puerto Rico have been battered by hurricanes and earthquakes. They need humanitarian assistance now..  . @NydiaVelazquez, @AOC and I say to Trump: Do your job and release the $18 billion in disaster funding that Congress already approved."
"Since Day One of this crisis, Trump downplayed the danger, disregarded science, refused to make protective gear we need.. . Now he says, “Hey, I'm tough! Ignore those Democrats. Let's get back to work.”. . 100,000 are dead. We still have no national testing strategy. What a disgrace."
This is truly outrageous. Congress needs to be working urgently to protect the health of the American people—not threatening the health care of millions of low-income people.
Tomorrow night: a discussion on one of the biggest issues facing our country—the likes of which you'd never see in the mainstream media. I hope you will tune in.
"Trump’s budget to Congress makes annual funding cuts of:. . $167,000,000 to Health Preparedness. $175,000,000 to Centers for Disease Control. $3,000,000,000 to National Institutes of Health. . But I’m sure the American people will be just overjoyed by this generous $100,000 donation."
"Donald Trump said, “My tax breaks will benefit working families—not the richest!”. . But 83% of his tax cuts will go to the top 1% after 10 years.. . It helped create the absurdity of Amazon not paying a nickel in federal taxes on $11 billion of profit..  . Trump is a liar and a fraud."
"My Republican colleagues had no problem voting for a trillion dollars in tax breaks for billionaires and large corporations.. . But—horrors of horrors!—poor workers might get a few bucks more in unemployment in the midst of a terrible crisis. Oh my god, the universe is collapsing!"
"The American people are sick and tired of brutal police killings without consequences. It’s time to fundamentally reform our racist and broken criminal justice system, end qualified immunity and hold police officers accountable. #BreonnaTaylor"
"I have a radical idea. Instead of listening to lobbyists in Washington, maybe, just maybe, we should listen to the American people who believe we should strengthen, not weaken, Wall Street regulations."
"Instead of trying to bring us together as a people, Trump is trying to divide us up. And, in the process, divert our attention away from the real crises facing the working families of this nation."
"Trump is worried about America becoming a ""socialist nation."" That is exactly what Republicans said about Social Security in 1935 and what they said about Medicare in 1965. Guess what? These are the two most popular programs in the country."
"I say to Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump: Instead of repealing the estate tax, let’s substantially increase this tax on multi-millionaires and billionaires and reduce wealth inequality in America."
"Today is the 55th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act. Seven years ago, it was gutted by the Supreme Court, leading to a wave of voter suppression laws.. . Our job now is to restore and expand the Voting Rights Act, fight voter suppression, and guarantee the right to vote."
"Maybe, just maybe, when the two wealthiest people in this country own more wealth than the bottom 40%, it’s time for bold action. It’s time to end the obscene levels of wealth inequality in this country."
"If its CEO @SteveEasterbrk gets paid $85 million over three years, @McDonalds can damn well pay all its workers at least $15 an hour. @McDonaldsCorp market value grew $71 billion while it paid the average cashier a starvation wage of $9 an hour. Shameful."
"Lauren is one of the 800,000 young people who grew up in our country and is now living in fear of being deported."
Our job as a humane society is not to throw millions of people off of health care. It's to make health care a right. #HealthCareDebate
Please take a moment to read the replies here. Every other major country has made health care a right. The U.S. is the anomaly. Remember that.
"From my family to yours—on behalf of Jane, our four kids, seven grandkids and myself—I would like to wish everyone a very happy Thanksgiving."
"On #CyberMonday, shoppers will rely on the U.S. Postal Service for fast, reliable, and affordable shipping. But Mr. Trump wants to privatize and destroy it.. . These good-paying unionized jobs lifted families like @MrDannyGlover's into the middle class—we must protect them."
"These Patriotic Millionaires understand what a disastrous Supreme Court decision Citizens United was. Democracy should be one person, one vote. Not Billionaires buying elections."
"Last Tuesday, Trump said “I’m proud to shut down the government.” And he did. Despite unanimous Republican support in the Senate and overwhelming Republican support in the House, Trump will leave 800,000 federal employees without paychecks. How’s that for a holiday gift?"
"It will take student borrowers 100 years to repay their debt for the ""crime"" of getting a higher education. That is insane.. . We have got to hit the reset button. We should cancel all student debt in this country and make Wall Street pay for it."
"Thousands of teachers in a so-called ""red state"" are marching to demand support for our kids over more handouts to billionaires. That is what real change looks like."
"How sad is it that we now have students in this country who are expecting violence in their schools. As Congresswoman @RosaDelauro says, the Congress must stand up to the NRA and pass gun safety legislation. Enough is enough."
All people have the right to protest for a better future. I call on the Iranian government to end the internet blackout and stop violence against demonstrators.
The Budget Committee is this morning holding a hearing on a simple question: Why should the taxpayers of this country subsidize starvation wages at some of the largest and most profitable corporations in America?
"The time is now to address the enormous crisis facing seniors who are unable to get the dental care, the hearing aids, and the optical care that they need."
"Amidst massive income and wealth inequality tens of millions of Americans are working for starvation wages. We need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, at least $15 an hour. No more excuses. We need to act NOW."
"The American people are sick and tired of profitable corporations like Amazon, General Motors, Chevron and Delta making billions in profits, but paying nothing in federal income taxes. Working together, we will end a rigged tax code and political system."
The fight for net neutrality is not over. We can overturn the FCC's disastrous decision but we need your help.
Republicans used the budget process to give $1.9 trillion in tax breaks mostly to the top 1% and tried to throw 30 million people off their health care. We are using it to address the crises facing working families.
Abu Bakr al Baghdadi was a murderer and terrorist responsible for terrible suffering and death. The fight against ISIS would not be possible without the brave efforts of the Kurds and other U.S. allies.
"Macy's made $1 billion in profits last year.. . Its CEO makes 580 times more than the median worker.. . Macy's paid $0 in taxes in 2017.. . Now it's laying off 2,000 hard-working employees to make more profits.. . Corporate America's greed has got to end."
Every other major country has made the morally principled and financially responsible decision to make health care a right to all of their people. Those who say this goal is unachievable are selling the American people short.
The debate over climate change in Washington really has nothing to do with science. It has everything to do with campaign contributions.
"Our postal workers already had one of the most important jobs in America.. . Now they are putting themselves at risk to deliver everything our country needs.. . I am asking the Postal Service to do much, much more to protect their safety and wellbeing right now."
"Amazon's Jeff Bezos won't join our hearing Wednesday on income and wealth inequality. But Jennifer Bates, who works at Mr. Bezos' warehouse in Alabama where workers are fighting to form a union, will be with us."
"Money is not speech..  . Corporations are not people..  . Let us end Citizens United, move to the public funding of elections and restore our democracy."
