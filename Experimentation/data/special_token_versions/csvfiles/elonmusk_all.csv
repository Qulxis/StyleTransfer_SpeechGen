17,<|elonmusk|><|polite|><|model|><|undefined|>@CathieDWood We aren‚Äôt cutting the price of Model 3 to $25k. I was referring to a future car that will be smaller than Model 3.
18,"<|elonmusk|><|polite|><|violate|><|nations|>@weinbergersa Wow, you‚Äôre ignorant. Don‚Äôt remember you, but disclosing classified US missile technology to hostile nations would violate ITAR law & land you in jail. I didn‚Äôt review it, but my team did. Obviously nobody cared about what your article said. Please."
19,"<|elonmusk|><|polite|><|engineering|><|execs|>@amir Can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre even writing about this. My job as CEO is to focus on what‚Äôs most critical, which is currently Model 3 production.

22,"<|elonmusk|><|polite|><|production|><|undefined|>@WholeMarsBlog Prototypes are a piece of cake, but high volume production of a new technology is extremely hard. Takes much longer than people think to climb the production S-curve. I can‚Äôt emphasize enough that production is by *far* the hard part."
23,"<|elonmusk|><|polite|><|twitter|><|filings|>@Teslarati 20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be *much* higher.. .

25,"<|elonmusk|><|polite|><|bobbyblackstock|><|olivas|>@bobbyblackstock @c12olivas Funny thing is, whenever I suggest all companies go to zero incentives, room gets very quiet. That's because others get a lot more than us."
26,"<|elonmusk|><|polite|><|cluster|><|soumiksf|>@soumiksf @ID_AA_Carmack Dojo uses our own chips & a computer architecture optimized for neural net training, not a GPU cluster. Could be wrong, but I think it will be best in world."
27,"<|elonmusk|><|polite|><|orbital|><|things|>@nextspaceflight There is the internal goal if things go right, which needs to be aggressive. Obviously, some things will not go right internally & there will be external issues too. . . That said, I think we can stack an orbital ship on an orbital booster in July."
28,"<|elonmusk|><|polite|><|freedom|><|conflicts|>@doctorow I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest & failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right."
29,"<|elonmusk|><|polite|><|obtuse|><|undefined|>@WholeMarsBlog We were too obtuse for our own good, although I think it works esthetically. Those are folded-over current collectors at the top/bottom of the cell, which are important, but I don‚Äôt want to jump the gun on Sept 22 ‚Ä¶"
30,"<|elonmusk|><|polite|><|spacecom|><|undefined|>@spacecom They are often right, but, in this case, we have already retired so much R&D risk on Dragon 2, that I feel very confident of 2018."

32,"<|elonmusk|><|polite|><|nasa|><|christmas|>@teslaownersSV @NASA I thought we had lost for sure. We were just a tiny company back then, only 1 of 4 launches got to orbit & I had no money left. Out of the blue, a few days before Christmas, NASA calls to say we won."

65,"<|elonmusk|><|polite|><|july|><|upgrade|>@jgrano305 @uhaveanygrapes @Flash_Titans This would be a good time to upgrade to FSD, as it goes up by $1k on July 1. We could make it $7k to upgrade to FSD until July 1 (even if you don‚Äôt have basic Autopilot). Does that sound good?"
