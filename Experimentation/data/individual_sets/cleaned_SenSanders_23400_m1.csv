You’re not a “different” kind of Republican by proposing a budget that would eliminate heating assistance to 6 million families in this country by abolishing the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program.
The Supreme Court just allowed Michigan to continue gerrymandering districts to benefit Republicans.. . Our job: Fight back. Expand voter turnout. Make state legislatures and courts end partisan gerrymandering. Overturn Citizens United. Create a vibrant democracy.

"If you believe that corporations are subject to regulation by the people, sign here: #savingdemocracy"
"While 1 in 5 seniors are scraping by on less than $13,500/year, our job is not to cut Social Security. Our job: expand Social Security so that every American can retire with dignity, and every person with a disability can live with the security they need."

Protecting our environment is not a radical idea.
"Starbucks could give every one of its 383,000 workers a $5,000 bonus & still keep $2.6 billion in profits from last year. Instead they're raising prices while spending $20 billion on stock buybacks & dividends when profits are up 31%. Don't blame inflation. Blame corporate greed."

The message President Trump sent out to racists and Neo-Nazis all over the country this past weekend is this is okay.
A week ago Trump fired Comey. Now this. It's vitally important that Trump make public any recordings he has of talks in the Oval Office.
The truth is we can't afford another spending package that expands the billionaire class's power and wealth at the expense of everyone else.
"Instead of listening to CEOs who have rigged our trade deals to benefit those on top, it is time to start listening to working families."
"Today, the top 1% owns more wealth than the bottom 90%."
Need further proof that the Republican tax bill is a massive giveaway to the largest corporations? The Republican tax bill hands 15 corporations a $236 billion tax break.

It's extremely concerning that the person charged with administering Medicare would rather throw 32 million Americans off of health insurance than join every major nation and guarantee health care as a fundamental right.
The economic and political systems of this country are stacked against ordinary Americans.
"Income and wealth inequality is soaring. Today, 1 in 4 U.S. workers are either unemployed or earn a poverty wage of less than $20,000 a year. Meanwhile, the 50 richest Americans own more wealth than the bottom 50%. We have got to create an economy that works for all, not the 1%."

"The internment of Japanese Americans is a stain on our history. It abhorrent that 75 years later, this administration now wants to hold migrant children in one of those same camps. . . We will look back on Trump’s racist child prisons as an abomination."
The fact that Congressional Republicans and the White House would release a memo the FBI itself says is misleading is a sad example of a political party putting partisanship above patriotism.
Republicans are clearly more loyal to gun lobbyists than our children. I support @POTUS's executive actions to make our communities safer.
"I wish I could say that we as a country have made enough progress for all Americans to truly be equal by now. But, no, our fight must go on."
I asked Trump's budget director a very simple question: Why do billionaires need tax breaks at the expense of working families?
Moving to a single-payer health care system will end the injustice of families being burdened by needlessly high copayments and deductibles.

"Between 2008 and 2015, General Electric received more in tax credits than it paid in actual taxes and is still in line for a $16 billion tax cut next year."
"Unfortunately, Sen. McConnell has decided to go against Justice Ginsburg's dying wishes and is cementing a shameful legacy of brazen hypocrisy.. . The right thing to do here is clear, and Senate Republicans know it. We should let voters decide. Period."

"Medicare for All is not a crazy idea.. . What's crazy is that our health care system is designed to make as much profit for insurance and pharma executives as possible, while ordinary people die because they can't afford the care and medicine they need."
Are we comfortable as a nation to see a huge increase in millionaires and billionaires but have more people living in poverty than ever?
Widespread mask wearing could save tens of thousands of lives and $1 trillion in economic activity.. . @ASlavitt and I believe our government must lead the effort to produce and distribute high-quality masks for every American at no cost: Masks for All.
The average worker pays $760 in extra taxes each year to close the revenue gap left by the 50 largest corporations hiding profits offshore.
How does it happen that the pharmaceutical companies can charge any price they want for prescription drugs? . . The answer is clear: The prescription drug industry is one of the most powerful political forces in America.

Get the Veto Pen Ready:
"Rather than an economy aimed at the common good, deregulation and Reaganomics have left us with an economy operated by and for the top 1%."

"I will vote against William Barr’s nomination. I cannot support someone for attorney general who will not make public the full Mueller report, who opposes a woman’s right to control her own body and who supports the failed war on drugs. Mr. Barr’s nomination must be defeated."

"The science is clear: if we do not address climate change now, we will suffer greater and more frequent climate disasters and the Earth will become increasingly uninhabitable. .  . It’s time we listen to scientists, not the fossil fuel industry."
"Instead of asking the very wealthy to pay a nickle more in taxes they want to go after the sick, poor, and elderly. #Budget"
"The Walton family of Walmart is the wealthiest family in America, worth $180 billion. Middle class taxpayers should not have to subsidize Walmart’s horrendously low wages to the tune of at least $6.2 billion every year."
Millions depends on Medicaid for opioid treatment. Trump's solution is to cut Medicaid by $1 trillion. That is a disgrace.
Trump's decision on DACA is the ugliest and most cruel decision ever made by a president of the U.S. in the modern history of this country.
"Bernie's first #DailyCut: under their budget proposal 200,000 kids would be thrown off of Head Start. #p2 #VT"
Methane is a greenhouse gas 86 TIMES more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere.. . President Trump is apparently comfortable with the destruction of our planet if it means he can hand favors to fossil fuel industry billionaires.
We are practically the only nation that doesn't offer family leave so that parents can be with their baby. That to me is an enormous shame.

We must stand up to the ruling class.
Bernie found conflicts of interest at the Fed: So he's gathering a team of economists to fix it:
"No, President Trump, the economy is not “absolutely booming” when nearly 80 percent of workers live paycheck to paycheck. Instead of an agenda for the wealthy few, we need to create an economy that works for all of us."
Are we satisfied as a nation when so few have so much and so many have so few?
Nearly 4 million seniors experience food insecurity. We must ensure that the generation that built our great nation does not go hungry.
Most Americans don’t have millions to spend on lobbying like the drug industry does. That doesn’t mean Congress can just ignore their needs.

Nobody said it would be easy to take on the drug and insurance companies and special interests who make billions from our dysfunctional health care system. . . But we will win this struggle for Medicare for All because the American people understand that health care is a right.

This is a rigged economy. CEOs of companies that pay some of the lowest wages in America—often employing essential workers—saw their pay increase by an average of 29% in 2020. . . And the workers? A 2% decrease in pay in 2020. That is absurd.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.): #Vt #Vermont #Budget #ACA #Obamacare #SinglePayer
The question is simple: Does Congress have the guts and courage to finally take on the greed of the billionaires and large corporations?
"A one-time $1,200 check isn't nearly enough to make ends meet. Congress has a responsibility to make sure every working-class American receives a $2,000 emergency payment a month so they can pay their bills.. . The American people want action from Congress and they want it NOW."
"The American People Have Spoken - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), @HuffingtonPost: #Syria"
"Today, I am demanding that Catalyst explain why they raised the price of this drug by $375,000. No one in the United States of America should die because they cannot afford the medication they need."
"Sanders and Grassley (R-Iowa) yesterday introduced their ""Employ America Act"""
The right to vote is preservative of all other rights.
"Combining these pieces of legislation would push the price tag of the bill to over $1 trillion – with very little scrutiny. Meanwhile, we've spent month after month discussing if we can afford to protect the children, the elderly, the sick, the poor and the future of our planet."
Happy National Maple Syrup Day! Vermont is the biggest producer of maple syrup in America—producing nearly 2 million gallons of maple syrup last year alone. That's a lot of syrup.
Has the administration estimated how many people would die if 23 million Americans are thrown off of health insurance?
"""Current levels of production are sufficient, yet millions of people are still suffering and dying of starvation."" – Pope Francis"
Sen. Bernie Sanders talks with @TavisSmiley:
"The founders of Amazon, Facebook & Google increased their wealth by $162 billion during the pandemic, while the companies they control enjoy monopoly power. It's time to break up big tech, tax the wealth of billionaires and create an economy that works for all of us, not the 1%."
The richest 400 Americans own $2.9 trillion—the size of the entire UK economy.. . These 400 billionaires pay a lower tax rate than the half of Americans living paycheck to paycheck.. . The rich have waged 45 years of class war. It’s about time working people stand up and fight back.

"You know what Trump won't be talking about in his State of the Union? He will surely not be apologizing for the many lies he told American voters: how he promised to defend the interests of working people, but then sold them out to Wall Street and the billionaire class."
"Last year, the five largest drug companies in America made nearly $60 billion in profits. The top five pharma CEOs made over $113 million in total compensation in 2017.. . Meanwhile, 1 in 5 Americans can’t afford their prescriptions. That should outrage every member of Congress."
"Nearly half a century ago, the Supreme Court affirmed abortion as a constitutional right.. . I am sick and tired of conservatives who say, ""Get government off our backs,"" while telling women what they can do with their bodies.. . Women get to control their bodies—not politicians."

"It is a moral outrage that the wealthiest family in America, the Walton family, still refuses to pay workers at Walmart at least $15 an hour. Over the past 3 years, the Walton family became $84 billion richer, while Walmart's minimum wage has remained stuck at $11. Unacceptable."
"As people are getting laid off and families are worried about their next meal, it is truly beyond my comprehension why the Trump Administration is fighting to kick 700,000 people off nutrition assistance in the middle of this pandemic."

Happening now: Sen. Sanders is on @CNN talking with @WolfBlitzer in the @CNNSitRoom.
Trickle-down economics has always been a fraud. It is an idea propagated by big-money interests to give an intellectual veneer for more tax breaks for billionaires.
If you look at what Scott Walker has tried to do to unions in Wisconsin it is clear there is a war on the middle class in this country.
"These deaths are what a broken immigration system is all about. Instead of demonizing immigrants, Trump should be meeting with Central American leaders to find ways to end the horrific violence and poverty that are forcing people to flee their homelands."
"With so many people facing economic desperation, Congress cannot recess until we pass a COVID-19 relief bill that includes at least $1,200 in direct payments for adults, $500 for kids, expanded unemployment benefits and emergency aid for states and cities to prevent mass layoffs."
"Here's the good news: since November 2012, more than 20 states and 40 cities and counties have raised their minimum wages. We're winning the fight for a living wage."
"We are rapidly moving toward a nation of the super-rich, by the super-rich and for the super-rich."
Every Republican except the chairman has left the budget hearing on the tax bill. Why are they afraid to defend their plan to raise taxes on 87 million middle class households?
Help Sen. Bernie Sanders stop the sale of American democracy:
"My dad came from a very poor, rural area in Poland. He raised a family and became a very proud American.. . When Trump demonizes minorities and immigrants, he wants to divide us up.. . We must build a political movement to create a different kind of America—with values that unite us."
AR-15s have one purpose: to kill and maim human beings.. . Ban assault weapons.
"In 1923, researchers who discovered insulin sold the patent for $1 so it would be available to all. But drug companies hijacked this lifesaving medicine and now charge over $300 a vial..  . Let’s be clear about this: Big Pharma’s greed is literally killing people in this country."
Happening now: Sen. Sanders is on #MSNBC talking with @WeGotEd.
"We have got to do everything we can to make sure that right now, our people are safe, get the paychecks that they need, receive medical care for free, and have a roof over their heads.. . All American workers must be made whole."

"It's unacceptable that, last year, the top 25 hedge fund managers earned more income than 425,000 public school teachers."
It is not just a coincidence that 46% of all new income is going to the top 1%. That is the result of an economy that is rigged in favor of the wealthy.
"To stop the spread of the coronavirus, and to reduce the obscene racial disparities in our criminal justice system, we must take urgent federal action to dramatically reduce the prison population."

"If you haven’t taken action yet, we need your voice. Only together can we create a political revolution that will turn this country around."
"It is imperative that we have the courage to stand with the poor, to stand with working people and, when necessary, take on the powerful."
"When two-thirds of American seniors rely on Social Security benefits for most of their income, we must expand Social Security - not cut it!"
"Amazon, Delta, Starbucks, Chevron and General Motors each paid $0 in federal taxes..  . If these five companies paid their 21% corporate tax rate, we'd have enough revenue to end homelessness in America and stop the horror of people dying in the cold."
Actually 89 out of the top 100 pharmaceutical corporations spent more on marketing and sales than on R&D.
"We have got to fundamentally rewrite our trade policy laws so that American products, not jobs, are our number one export."
No one with cancer should have to beg for money on GoFundMe.. . No one should die because they can't pay for insulin.. . No one with coronavirus should be afraid to see a doctor.. . We must tax billionaires' pandemic profits to make health care a right for all.
Our nation has always been a refuge for the oppressed. We must unite families not tear them apart. The deportation raids must end.

"Please RT: Follow Bernie on Twitter and you'll be entered to win a signed copy of his book, The Speech, this Friday at noon."
"It is incomprehensible to me, and I believe to the vast majority of Americans, as to why Republicans would oppose commonsense gun safety."
Trump’s so-called health care plan is a massive transfer of wealth from working families to the very richest people.

The great political issue now facing our country is not Democrat vs. Republican or progressive vs. conservative. It's much deeper than that. It's about democracy vs. authoritarianism.
Solitary confinement is a form of torture. It is unconstitutional. It has got to be abolished as part of comprehensive reform to our racist criminal justice system.

We must recognize that allowing all qualified students to achieve a higher education is an investment in our nation's economic prosperity.
I have a radical idea for my colleagues. What if we occasionally—we don’t have to overdo it—listening to the people who sent us to Congress?
"Last week, 6.6 million applied for unemployment. Millions more will lose their jobs in the coming weeks. In the midst of this horrific crisis, Congress must pass a new, unprecedented emergency bill that guarantees income and health care for all Americans. Working on details now."

"Americans don't know what's in the Build Back Better plan because the corporate media doesn't discuss it. Let's stop the beltway gossip and start talking about lowering prescription drug costs, expanding Medicare, childcare and housing – and combatting climate change."
"We must work together to make Social Security solvent for our kids and grandchildren by lifting the cap on taxable income above $250,000."
"If my memory is correct, this is exactly what the #NoDAPL movement warned about. It is why I stood with them in 2011 to oppose the expansion of the Keystone pipeline. . . We must clean up this disaster and immediately transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy."

"How the hell can corporations going bankrupt and laying off workers still hand out million-dollar bonuses to their CEOs?. . CEOs love this game: Heads, I win. Tails, you lose.. . This is why workers must get a say in their companies and seats on their boards."

"As coronavirus cases rise, nurses are demanding that this for-profit, corporate hospital chain provide them with the protective gear and staffing support they need to care for their patients.. . I stand with the nurses striking across this country today."
The benchmark of full time work in America should be simple – that no full-time worker should live in poverty.
"I remember talking to a young woman in Vermont who left medical school with $300,000 in debt. . . Her crime? She wanted to become a doctor and work with low-income people.. . She shouldn’t be punished with a debt of $300,000. College indebtedness is a horror."
"Last year, one-in-five Americans couldn’t afford to buy the medicine prescribed by their doctor. Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies made billions in profits and spent hundreds of millions on CEO compensation. We must end their greed."

"Amazon made $10.8 billion in profits, didn't pay a dime in federal taxes, and got a $129 million check from the IRS—courtesy of Mitch McConnell and the Republican Senate.. . But as our people suffer, a $2,000 check to the working class is ""socialism for the rich""? Give me a break."

"More than 13 million American children live in poverty.. . Our childhood poverty rate is among the highest of any major country on Earth.. . In my view, we should feed the children first, educate the children first, and worry about the military-industrial complex later."
We must go beyond fine speeches if we're serious about protecting the needs of veterans. They've protected us. Now we must protect them.

Republicans want the American people to believe Social Security is in crisis and must be cut. They are dead wrong.
"The federal government bailed out the banks. Trump and the Republicans gave huge tax cuts to the wealthy. Congress is about to hand $10 billion to Jeff Bezos to go the moon. Yes, we can afford to cancel all student debt."
The bloated Pentagon budget continues to pour money into outdated weapons systems that don’t function properly. That has got to change.
"The greed of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Citigroup and BlackRock is insatiable. Who cares if the Saudis are starving millions of Yemeni civilians or that our planet faces a climate emergency? Profiting off of $1.5 trillion in Saudi oil is just too important."
Read this week's version of the Week in Review here:
Sen. Sanders' statement on Pres. Obama's #SOTU Address:
Republicans want to throw millions more people off health care and raise premiums on low-income seniors. We can't let that happen.
Our challenge is to see if we have the courage and political will to make health care a right to all.
The rich get much richer and the Republicans think they need more help. I do not believe those are the priorities of the American people.
Do you want to know why you're being ripped off every day by drug companies? Maybe it's because there are two Big Pharma lobbyists for every member of Congress.
Washington works very well for the wealthiest in this country:
Americans are sick and tired of seeing drug prices soar when the 5 major drug companies made $50 billion in profits last year.

Got an opinion? Tell Bernie what you thought of President Obama's speech tonight. #Obama #Budget
Build Back Better is an enormously important piece of legislation. The American people have a right to know what's in it.
"Mnuchin's economics experience? Being called the ""Foreclosure King"" for heading a bank that kicked 50,000 families out of their homes.. . Keep going, Greta. Scientists tell us we must transform our economy to save the planet. Economists say we'll create millions of jobs doing so."
Outside spending in the 2012 election has now exceeded that of the last 7 elections combined. #CitizensUnited #SCOTUS
"As it happens, I personally believe that it is totally appropriate for the UN to focus on poverty in the United States – the richest county in the history of the world."
We should establish a Wall Street speculation fee to ensure that large financial institutions pay their fair share.
"Three people own more wealth than the bottom half of our country. 25 hedge fund managers earn twice as much as all 140,000 kindergarten teachers. One family (Kochs) spent $400 million to buy elections. That's why we need a political revolution."
What I find really disturbing is that Treasury Secretary Lew and my Republican friends who support the #chainedCPI.

"Are our memories so short that we have learned nothing from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression just 10 years ago? Unbelievably, Congress now wants to deregulate some of the same banks that helped cause the 2008 financial disaster."

It is more than irresponsible for my Republican colleagues to risk the future of our planet in order to pander to fossil fuel lobbyists.
Pope Francis is right. Health care should not be a privilege only for the wealthy.
Top Economists to Advise Sanders on Fed Reform:
"And after providing a massive tax break for the wealthy that will blow a $1.5 trillion hole in the deficit, Trump complains about the domestic spending initiatives secured by the Democratic Caucus to address the needs of working families and the middle class."
"There already is far too much media concentration in this country. We need more diversity, more local ownership, more viewpoints. @AjitPaiFCC's decision is a massive step backwards."

Sen. Mitch McConnell is Wrong: #SandersVsMcConnell
"Mr. Trump, watch these Patriotic Millionaires explain how to stimulate the economy. It's not by giving massive tax breaks to your billionaire friends."
These millionaires want President Trump to know there is nothing patriotic about shifting the tax burden onto the middle class.
"I proudly oppose Trump's NAFTA 2.0. The United States outsourced more than 170,000 jobs in the last three years. The deal doesn't even mention the words ""climate change."". . Our trade agreements must stop outsourcing and address the climate crisis threatening our planet."

"Unfortunately, we have a corrupt political system and some Senators are more interested in getting campaign contributions from the wealthy and the powerful than doing the work of the American people. It’s a sad state of affairs."

Today’s news from Sen. Sanders: Charleston shooting “an act of terror”
Yesterday Trump suggested that members of Congress who don't mindlessly stand and applaud his every word are guilty of “treason.” The great political issue now facing our country is not Democrat vs. Republican. It's about democracy vs. authoritarianism.
The question facing the American people is: Are we going to fight for our democracy or will it be taken over by billionaires?
Bernie is speaking on the floor of the Senate:
"Ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons. Prohibit high-capacity magazines. Expand background checks. End the gun show loophole. If we can’t get 60 votes in the Senate, then we must end the filibuster."
Congress must ensure that the greed and recklessness of Wall Street can never destroy the livelihood of everyday Americans ever again.
"How the hell are Americans supposed to stay home safely when utility companies are shutting their water off?.  . We must restore service to families who've been disconnected, forgive all utility debt, and freeze future disconnections until this crisis ends."
"If Canada and every other major country on earth can guarantee paid leave, so can the United States. We must end this international embarrassment. (With @MadeleineSix)"

Black women make 60% of what a white man makes. That is nothing but sexism and discrimination. #BlackWomensEqualPay
Jason Hargrove’s death is an outrage—it should've never happened. Blue-collar workers are risking their lives to keep this country running. They deserve better.. . The federal government must require that all frontline workers get protective gear NOW.
Today in America over 20% of our children are living in poverty — the highest rate of childhood poverty of nearly any major country.
"85,000 children have starved to death in Yemen as a result of the Saudi-led war.. . U.S. participation in this war has not been authorized by Congress and is therefore unconstitutional.. . Tomorrow the Senate will vote to end U.S. support for this disastrous and unconstitutional war."
Today's modern-day loan sharks are no longer lurking on street corners—they wear Armani suits and work on Wall Street..  . @RepAOC and I have a “radical” idea: no bank in America should charge an interest rate higher than 15%.
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):
"Wealth of Elon Musk on March 18, 2020: $24.5 billion. Wealth of Elon Musk on January 9, 2021: $209 billion. . U.S. minimum wage in 2009: $7.25 an hour. U.S. minimum wage in 2021: $7.25 an hour. . Our job: Raise the minimum wage to at least $15, tax the rich & create an economy for all."
I strongly believe in civil political discourse. But how does one respond to a president who has complete disregard for reality?
"In my view, the #NSA is out of control and operating in an unconstitutional manner. #SXSW #Snowden"
"On many issues, we are divided, but comprehensive background checks are supported by 97 percent of Americans. President Trump is a coward whose failure to act threatens public safety."
"Republicans understand that their agenda of tax breaks for billionaires and cutting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid is unpopular, so they’re doing all they can to make it harder to vote in America. Shameful. We are going to go forward to protect democracy."
"When government involves itself in making the world we inhabit livable and rebuilding our infrastructure, we create millions of good jobs."
Billionaires get tax breaks. Teachers get broken chairs and flooded classrooms. As the wealthiest nation in history we've got to do better.

"While the top 1% own twice as much wealth as the bottom 99% of humanity, 420 million people throughout the world are in danger of slipping into extreme poverty and 30 million children are at risk of dying from hunger. We cannot allow that to happen."
There is something profoundly wrong when the top one-tenth of one percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.
"I think the average American, whether you’re Democrat, Republican, or Independent, can agree there is something absurd about two people owning more wealth than the bottom 40% of America and billionaires paying NOTHING in federal income tax."

We are one world and one people. And that belief leads me to the conclusion that we just cannot turn our back on human suffering.
"My hope is that the Republican leadership will examine these studies and junk their current ""health care"" bill."
Sen. Sanders is on his way to speak on the #Senate floor. Watch live here:
"""Here it is, we're giving millionaires tax cuts. You're going to give them $27,000... I can't even say that's half of my salary."" Arizona teachers like Tomorrah Howard are standing up to fight for fair pay."
Sen. Sanders is on his way to the senate floor to talk about #CitizensUnited. Sign his amendment here:
Do Not Balance Budget on Backs of Disabled Veterans: #budget #Veterans #FiscalCliff
"This crisis makes clear what we have known for decades.. . If we are sincere about the needs of ordinary Americans, we must pass a single-payer national program to guarantee health care for all Americans."
"It costs $30,000 to send a California student to UCLA for a year. To send someone to prison, it costs $75,000.. . We need to be a nation that invests in jobs and education, not jails and incarceration."
"Somehow, we have billions of dollars available for more jails and incarceration, but we ""can't afford"" to provide kids with the college education they need to survive in modern America. That doesn't make any sense to me."

The obscene level of income and wealth inequality in America is a profoundly moral issue that we cannot continue to ignore or sweep under the rug. A society cannot sustain itself when so few have so much while so many have so little.
"The cost of war is great, and it is far more than the hundreds of billions of dollars we spend on planes and guns."
The average middle class American family made less in 2012 than it did 24 years before in 1989.
"When we stand together, we win."
"The American people cannot afford to wait another month. Here is what we must do: . . In order to avoid another Great Depression, the Senate must pass legislation requiring the government to guarantee 100 percent of the paychecks and benefits of American workers up to $90,000/year."

"I want to thank my colleagues and the many people at the grassroots level who helped us pass this historic resolution. Today, 45 years after the passage of the War Powers Act, the U.S. Senate finally used that authority for the first time."
What do my Republican colleagues want to do to address the crises facing working families today? They want to give tax breaks to the wealthiest people in the country. That is obscene.
"How do we change the system to work for all Americans, not just the top 1%? Demand that Wall Street invest in the job-creating economy."
LIVE: Some of my colleagues in the Senate want to give in to the extortion of the microchip industry and hand them a $76 billion blank check. I say instead let’s enact the agenda the American people want.

"Today, the richest 1 percent of Americans own 41.8 percent of the nation’s financial wealth."

It’s good to see the Trump administration finally admit what some of us have been saying for a long time: the disastrous war in Yemen must end. . . Next month the Senate will have the chance to show we are serious about ending US support for this war by voting on SJ Res 54.
I sent a letter with 16 of my colleagues today asking President Biden to propose in his American Families Plan the most significant expansion of Medicare since it was signed into law to improve the lives of millions of Americans.

What do you think of Pres. @BarackObama's proposed Buffett Rule? Weigh in on Bernie's new poll:
"Those who want to maintain the status quo in which the rich get richer while ordinary Americans struggle to make ends meet oppose the reconciliation bill.. . Well, I disagree. Now is the time, finally, for Congress to stand up for working families."
"I know that people aren't comfortable when I say this, but I worry very, very much about the future of democracy in our country."
We need legislation which makes it possible for workers who want to join a union to do so. We must pass the Employee Free Choice Act.

...the ok from corporate America.
The American people understand: Taking care of veterans is as much a cost of war as tanks and guns. Our Congress needs to understand it too.
"Hey, Mr. President: Instead of copying France's military parade, why not copy France's health care system? Health care for all, low-cost prescription drugs, much less expensive."

We have got to end the two-tier justice system in this country – one for the poor and working class and one for Wall Street and the wealthy.
"Let us guarantee health care as a right for every man, woman and child in this country."
"No. There's absolutely no way Biogen should be allowed to charge patients $56,000 for the new Alzheimer's drug – costing Medicare up to $29 billion a year. We must take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry."
"Louis DeJoy, a top campaign contributor of Donald Trump, is the worst Postmaster General in American history. He should have been fired or removed from office a long time ago. We need a Postmaster General who will protect and strengthen the Postal Service, not sabotage it."
"Our job is to save the planet not make more profits for the oil, gas and coal industries. We must act boldly to transform our energy system."

"Foreign policy matters: After 20 years of U.S. effort, the loss of 2,448 soldiers and a trillion spent, Afghanistan was left with a corrupt government and an ineffectual military.  At this moment, we must do everything we can to evacuate our allies and open our doors to refugees."

"While Amazon raised prices by up to 1,000% on masks, soap & toilet paper, Jeff Bezos became $88 billion richer and continues to deny workers paid sick leave & hazard pay. That is morally obscene. Billionaires should not be profiteering off a pandemic. #TaxTheRich"
"Trump's sanctuary cities policy is federal coercion to enforce the president’s racist, anti-immigrant policies. This is a check on an out-of-control executive branch and a victory for the rule of law."
