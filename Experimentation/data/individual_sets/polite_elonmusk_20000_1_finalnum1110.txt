Will be a fun project for Tesla design. Love the idea of adding a special item every few months, so whenever you go into a Tesla store, there is something new & delightful to see.<|endoftext|>If you‚Äôd like to help develop Doge, please submit ideas on GitHub & @dogecoin_devs<|endoftext|>@EvaFoxU Note, we are trying to reduce delivery times as quickly as possible. Long wait times are not a good thing.<|endoftext|>@nickg_uk You can just take the aero inserts out of the standard wheel & it looks pretty cool. We could offer that as an option at purchase.<|endoftext|>@dancow @tedhu @chadgowens @scottwww @JessicaHuseman That was obvious from a mile away. I tried to use their product & it didn‚Äôt work. Not exactly a genius move by WSJ, but they were brave enough to say it.<|endoftext|>Great DragTimes video of people experiencing P85D "Insane Mode" acceleration for the first time<|endoftext|>@robintosh_nunez @PPathole Interesting. My Thursday night saliva sample came back today with N1 gene (unique to cov2) showing at cycle 26 & N3 (generic sars) at 24. I get results of today‚Äôs test tomorrow. Almost no symptoms today, so hopefully better results.<|endoftext|>@PinballReed @crikey_news @ummjackson @cameronwilson My kids wrote better code when they were 12 than the nonsense script Jackson sent me. . . Like I said, if it‚Äôs so great, he should share it with the world and make everyone‚Äôs experience with Twitter better. If he does, you will see what I mean.. . Jackson Palmer is a tool.<|endoftext|>Thanks Tesla owners. You rock!! ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è<|endoftext|>@EuricSanti @luisabinader @Tesla Thank you, Tesla is most honored!<|endoftext|>Good Starship SN8 static fire!

My precious...<|endoftext|>@tomkiss Probably mid next year before we are able to make RHD. Wish it could be sooner. Maybe try a Model S, used or new in the meantime? Used S is better than a new 3 imo, unless you want a smaller car.<|endoftext|>Tomorrow will be the 7th flight of this rocket, landing on droneship Of Course I Still Love You<|endoftext|>@LanceUlanoff Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling & driving feel. Extremely important metric.<|endoftext|>@amitkatwala @WiredUK Mostly accurate, even though I didn‚Äôt do an interview (or pose for cover)<|endoftext|>@ScottAdamsSays There are times when I feel like I‚Äôm living in a Dilbert cartoon<|endoftext|>@Teslarati @KlenderJoey I was at Giga Texas yesterday. Team is making excellent progress. Building will be almost a mile long when complete.<|endoftext|>@VitoTheGreat_ I love dogs & memes<|endoftext|>@WholeMarsBlog If you don‚Äôt say anything & engage Autopilot, it will soon guess based on time of day, taking you home or to work or to what‚Äôs on your calendar<|endoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @NASA @VP I think so. For sure worth giving it our best shot! Would be great to have a competitive, commercial program to build a moon base that is outcome-oriented (not cost-plus), so you only get paid for safe delivery of cargo.<|endoftext|>@JohnHanzl Sorry, meant to say LOX header tank in tip of nose.

Condolences to JB and his family.<|endoftext|>@EffinZach The robots are coming anyway, as Boston Dynamics videos clearly show. . . I will not be able to ensure that robots made by other companies are safe, but I can try my best to do so at Tesla.<|endoftext|>@ScottAdamsSays @NickCannon We know so little today. I want to know the meaning of life or whatever the right question is to ask, as Douglas Adams would put it. . . Wait ‚Ä¶ are you guys related?<|endoftext|>@apple_defense @samabuelsamid Exactly!

UAW has major conflicts of interest & failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right.<|endoftext|>@gmalca @Tesla True, we somewhat overcompensated on Bluetooth antenna capability haha.
