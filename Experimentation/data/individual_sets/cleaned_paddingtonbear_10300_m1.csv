I'm giving Mrs Bird a paw this afternoon to help make the pumpkin pie. I wonder if it will go well with marmalade...
@HarperCollinsCh They seem a bit complicated. I think they may take me longer to understand than bathrooms.
Mrs Bird has taught me her 'dusting dance.' I wish spring cleaning was always this fun. #PocketMoney

Very pleased that Mr. Gruber has just accepted Mrs Brown’s invitation to join us in watching the #EnglandvPeru football game tomorrow night
Judy says that it takes 43 muscles to frown but only 17 muscles to smile. Maybe that's why Mr Curry looks tired.
"Afternoons are long enough for at least two slices of cake, especially when it's a Bank Holiday."
Judy’s friend lives on Windsor Gardens and it’s her birthday tomorrow but she can’t have a party. We're going to message our neighbours to ask them to make signs to put in their window so she can see them when she looks out from her home and feel special. #BirthdayWindows
"Charades or a walk? I think the toss of a chocolate coin, or two, will help us decide."
